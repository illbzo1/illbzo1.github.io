    <!-- jessica doesn't like lot, too many ands, uses the word 'easy' too much -->
    I'm a big fan of retargeting and PPC networks. I mostly write long form copy, so shorter copy can be a nice change of pace. Especially since I get easy access to sweet, sweet data. I'm into continual improvement and data-driven testing, and I've created, managed, and optimized several display ad campaigns. I like email marketing as well, and I've enjoyed running several blast email campaigns as well as long term customer lifecycle messaging.

    These are creatives from a retargeting campaign for DocRaptor. I wrote copy based on the features DocRaptor customers care about most - ease of use, quality of output, and reliable infrastructure.

    These are ads from an automated email marketing campaign for Instrumental. I wrote the copy with Instrumental's value proposition in mind - a highly configurable, customized approach to application monitoring, designed to provide deeper levels of insight than similar products on the market.
