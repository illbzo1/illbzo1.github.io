    This is a variation of a landing page for an application monitoring campaign for Instrumental. As part of a bigger overhaul in Instrumental's marketing, I wanted to determine what sort of copy converted. I focused on the kinds of questions Instrumental could answer, based on a user's application data. Visitors to this page were evenly split between each variation.

    This copy talks about the problems a potential user will run into when they're operating an application. The thought here was to convince visitors that a customized monitoring solution was a better fit for their application, and we provide real life examples to show how Instrumental works.
