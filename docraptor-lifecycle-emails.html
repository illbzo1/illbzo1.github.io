    This is a welcoming message sent to a new customer upon their first successful document creation request. The goal here is to make sure the customer is on the right path. Once a DocRaptor integration is working and successfully creating documents, the next step is to make sure the customer is getting the correct documents back.

    This email is sent 24 hours after a trialing customer signs up, if they have not created a document. The goal is to encourage trialing users to finish their implementation, and to let them know DocRaptor support is ready and willing to help out every step of the way.
