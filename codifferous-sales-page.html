    Second version of copy for Codifferous's sales page. The first version was performing rather well, but the copy was based on assumptions the team felt were faulty. I spent a week talking to 40 developers who cared about code review, writing copy to position Codifferous as a product that would solve the biggest issues developers faced - code review takes up too much time, and it's too difficult.

  	The revised copy saw a big improvement in conversion and adoption rates, as well as long-term improvement in organic results for search terms related to code review.
