    <strong>What about features designed for busy teams?</strong>
    <br />
    Making time for code review is difficult for teams that work remotely, or have different schedules.
    <br />
    Codifferous makes it easy to review code with your team, no matter where you live or when you're working. Did you miss out on a pull request? No problem. You can review code in any branch, leave comments, and get feedback at any time.
    <br />

    <strong>You review your Code</strong>
    <br />
    Quickly mark lines and files as reviewed, switch between branches, and leave comments for your team.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>We keep track of changes</strong>
    <br />
    Codifferous tracks the code you've read and makes it easy to see when code changes.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Code review is more than approving pull requests.</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Pull requests don't leave room for developers who can't review code before it ships, but still want to read and contribute. That's where Codifferous comes in. Developers use our code review service to identify problematic code, squash bugs in production, and get feedback from their team long after the pull request has closed.
