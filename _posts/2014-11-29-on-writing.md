"You have to get up in the morning and write like a drunk has to drink."

Eleven years later, this is still the best advice on being a writer I've ever heard.  One of my photography professors from college gave us this advice, given to him by one of his professors back in the 60s.

"The 60s...it was a terrible time. You should've been there."

His follow up advice wasn't as useful, but it's also stuck with me. I can still picture the day I heard this quote: the first day of class of my first actual photography class, nervous and excited, listening to a pompous man wearing a scarf in mid August. I had a hard time understanding why he was giving this advice, but he eventually related it to photography.

That quote stuck with him, too.

I've always wanted to be a writer - not just good at writing, but an author. You should see the notes I have for short stories, novellas, novels. Notes upon notes that I've been compiling and hoarding since I was 17. I went through and organized all of my old writing notes a few nights ago: text files with single sentences, rough outlines of short stories, folders full of notes that barely make any sense a decade after I wrote them.

I've spent a lot of time lately thinking about how I choose to spend my time, and whether I could put my time to better use, and the most obvious answer (as always) is "Write more."

I used to make time for writing. And I'm trying to make time once again.

I don't know that I need to get up first thing in the morning and bang out a thousand words (some more practical though less inspiration advice I've heard lately) but I absolutely want to get back in the habit of writing every day.

I've written about this quote before, I'm sure of it. Eleven years later and it's still banging around in my head, and I've had more than enough blogs over the years. But I'm less concerned about not repeating myself, and more concerned about getting back into the habit that's brought me endless amounts of satisfaction since I was eight years old.
