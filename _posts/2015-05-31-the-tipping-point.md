The Tipping Point is less a book strictly about marketing and more a book about what causes certain behaviors to spread. Why teen smoking continues to rise, despite a vigorous anti-smoking campaign. Why cracking down on graffiti and fare jumping in New York City leads to a steep decline in violent crime. What cause Airwalks to become incredibly popular for a few years in the mid-90s, and why their popularity died off.

I noticed an interesting thing while reading The Tipping Point. It's largely a book about psychology, and the behavior of groups, and I recognized many of the studies cited as studies that were also cited in Influence.

It's a fascinating look at how information spreads - from Paul Revere's midnight ride to how

"To appreciate the power of epidemics, we have to abandon this expectation about proportionality. We need to prepare ourselves for the possibility that sometimes big changes follow from small events, and that sometimes these changes can happen very quickly."

This is the tipping point.

Mavens, salesmen, connectors

What did I learn from this?

Interesting quotes:

"Expertise leads to more expertise. Why bother remembering how to install software if your son, close at hand, can do it for you? Since mental energy is limited, we concentrate on what we do best."

"Broken Windows theory and the Power of Context are one and the same. They are both based on the premise that an epidemic can be reversed, can be tipped, by tinkering with the smallest details of the immediate environment."

"We all want to believe the key to making an impact on someone lies with the inherent quality of the ideas we present."

"When a virus spreads through a population, it doubles and doubles again, until it has (figuratively) grown from a single sheet of paper all the way to the sun in fifty steps."
