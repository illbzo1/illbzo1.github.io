I finished up The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers by John Gardner earlier this week. Reading this book made me even more excited about writing. I felt those horrible wheels turning in my Underbrain, and several times I jumped up from my reading to take notes on something I wanted to write.

I take notes when I'm reading for learn. Reading for discovery is how I privately think of it, and I pause often while reading to send myself emails about relevant quotes, and fragments of the larger work that resonate with me.

*"It is partly in this way that the fictional process forces the writer to say more than he thought he could; that is, to make discoveries."*

This happens every time I sit down to write. A little window into my daily writing process: I come in armed with an outline, ready to bang out my daily word count, eager to work on the next scene, or series of scenes coming up next, according to the outline.

But things change. I know where I'm going (generally) but not how I'm going to get there. I've described writing a story as a bit like excavating. It's something like digging up a buried monument. An artifact whose shape I can see through loose soil, but not well enough to make out details. And the soil shifts underfoot as I dig.

I find characters saying things I didn't plan, and taking actions I didn't foresee. An example from this week: a boy and his younger brother are on a journey east in the story I'm working on. They've left a cabin in which they've been holed up for a few days, and the older brother insists they bring a shovel found in the cabin with them. Despite its weight, and without bothering to explain why.

I didn't anticipate this turn of events. I didn't see this detail coming, but it emerged, fully formed, making complete sense within the larger arc I'm working on. This is something not found in my outline, something I didn't plan, and which has imposed itself and made itself necessary to the plot. It's something more than a wrinkle (although wrinkles also appear while writing) and something heavier than texture. You make discoveries as you write. You find things out about your characters, the world you're creating, and the stories that take place there.

*"But if the writer writes only of what honestly interests him, and if he thinks of his work not simply as thoughtful exploration, as it should be, but also as entertainment, he cannot fail to have, at least for some group of serious, devoted readers, both immediate and lasting interest."*

This is a long sentence. Much longer than most I end up writing, but my take is if you're writing stories in the style you like reading, rather than simply writing to hone your technique or to explore ideas, you'll find success. If you're having fun with what you're writing, you'll be success. Every writer seeks glory, for some definition of glory. Every writer wants to see his work in the world, even if no one else ever reads it, and the surest path to get there is to write the stories you want to write.

There's a reason I've stuck to mostly horror (with a few side tracks into softish sci-fi) and that's because I like reading horror. I've been a fan of horror since I was a child. Horror is my number one jam, now and forever. I'm writing horror not because I think of it as a fun exercise (although it certainly is that) but because I enjoy horror, and because I derive immense pleasure and personal satisfaction from working on stories about awful things happening to perfectly nice people.
