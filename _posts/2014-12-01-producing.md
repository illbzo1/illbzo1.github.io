I am not the biggest fan of LifeHacker as a platform for content. Most of the articles I run across are boring, click-bait listicles with no substance. More fluff in a sea of bullshit content marketing. This isn't to say I think all content marketing is bullshit - I actually love well written, useful content marketing. But content marketing is the thing right now, and most of it is bullshit.

That said, we don't choose the things that move us, and you can find inspirato in the most unlikely of places. I found this article a while back:

[Start Every Day as a Producer, Not a Consumer](http://lifehacker.com/5887345/start-every-day-as-a-producer-not-a-consumer)

tldr; it's about starting the day off by making something. Clearing your mind of distractions and working on something productive, not checking Twitter, not checking your email. For me, this means writing, even if I'm just banging some early morning thoughts out on this blog.

Clay Johnson's selling his book [The Information Diet](http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/500-words-before-8am) with this article. This doesn't disgust me the way it might have when I was in college. Good for him - I applaud him for the hustle. He's got good advice, and he should sell a book about it.

He's set a benchmark of producing 500 words first thing in the morning. I don't think hard word count goals are very useful to me. It seems like I'd be writing long after I felt I was done writing, just to hit that limit, and that goes against my goal of writing every day.

Firstly, I want to write every day, not write a predetermined number of words every day. Secondly, I want to improve my ability to write, not my ability to consistently hit a word count.

So far, it's going well. I feel motivated, but motivation isn't enough. Desire is what counts, and I've been sharpening my own desire to write, forcing that old bastard out of bed, and it's like greeting my oldest friend after a long absence.
