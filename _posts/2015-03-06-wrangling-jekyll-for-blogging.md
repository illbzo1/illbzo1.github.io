Good news! I've finally mastered the fine art of using Jekyll to add a blog to my wonderful site. It actually wasn't that difficult. Most of my time was spent exploring the deep, dark caverns around properly setting a base_url until I just said "FUCK IT" and went with my root domain, which I'll swap out for local development.

Other than that, it's actually way easier than I thought it would be. I have a long-standing, nasty habit of building very simple tasks up to be monumental undertakings.

Speaking of which, I plan to spend some time this weekend porting all of my old blog posts over from blogspot, then fully migrating everything here.

Styling is still pretty boilerplate, but I'll get to that. The main thing is the blog is up, it works, and it's easier than I thought it would be. BONUS: made quite a bit of improvement with the layout, updating templates to be more templatey, DRYing shit up every, son.
