There's something about the third month of any new system I try that typically proves to be the failing point. In the past, I've lost motivation around month 3, my famous enthusiasm wanes, and I get bored. I move on to something else. I stop caring as much.

But it's not about working only when I'm motivated. I've noticed that I've been sinking into the doldrums (I haven't been working on this site as much as I might like, for one thing) but I'm still reading. I'm still writing, every single day. Still making progress, so let's talk about what I read in March.

This month, I read **Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life** by Annie Lamott, **Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion** by Robert Cialdini, and **How To Turn Words into Money** by Ted Nicholas.

[Bird by Bird](http://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427855361&sr=8-1&keywords=bird+by+bird) was my favorite of the three. I've already written a blog post mostly about this book, and although I found it to be a slow starter, it was a delight. Mostly a delight. Lamott is a bit pessimistic for my taste, but she had an interesting perspective on writing.

The other two were good, don't get me wrong. I especially liked [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427855417&sr=8-1&keywords=influence+the+psychology+of+persuasion), but mostly because it was better written than How to Turn Words into Money. Both books shared an optimism and an enthusiasm for the work at hand I did not find in Bird by Bird. Annie Lamott often focused too much on the negative parts of writing - the anxiety of being published, the fear of running out of ideas, the dread of writing yourself into a corner.

Influence was interesting, in that it's about the psychology of why people say yes. Why people buy things they don't need, why people choose one option over another, and how compliance professionals (love this term, by the way) can play on these factors to convince others to take desired actions. Influence is why you see a thousand logos on every marketing site. It's why you see user testimonials. It's why the phrase "thought leader" exists. An absolutely fascinating read! I've already begun noticing these tactics employed in the short time since I finished the book.

[How To Turn Words into Money](http://www.amazon.com/How-Turn-Words-Into-Money/dp/1887741011/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427855466&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+turn+words+into+money) was an interesting read, and not at all the book I thought it would be. I found it on a list of good copywriting books, and while it DOES touch on copywriting, all it does is touch on the subject. Nicholas also touches on infomercials, licensing your products to be sold overseas, running ads in the yellow pages, and so on. It's more of a shotgun approach to marketing, with a central theme of the words that convert into money, across a variety of media.

I'm still feeling good about my reading system. April is here, and I've read 9 books this year that I wouldn't have read without it. My writing system is working well. My editing system is basically garbage. I do not like editing my work, and still have not gotten through a second pass of my first story.

Short term goal for April: shore this up, find something that works. I'll write about it, don't worry!
