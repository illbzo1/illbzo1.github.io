title:  "What I Did in January: My Super Rad Writing System"

Using my super rad writing system (500 words per day, and 1,000 words per day on the weekends) I've written rough drafts for two short stories and I'm most of the way through a third. It's hard to calculate just how far I am into this third story. I've discovered something interesting about writing fiction - it doesn't always go according to plan.

I've scoffed at people who write without an outline (and I still do, it's MADNESS) but I have been surprised more than once at events that unfold while I'm writing. A character will make a surprise trip to a butcher's shop, and it all feels very natural even though I didn't plan on it in my rough outline before sitting down to write.

Suddenly those hilarious gems from [@nanowrimo_txt](https://twitter.com/nanowrimo_txt) make more sense. But not much more - let's not get crazy.

I wrote the first story using textedit, using folders and a ton of text files. This was not ideal, and I knew it, but it's how I did it.

I fully planned to switch to either [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) or [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) for the next story. I downloaded trials for both, but ended up using [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) when it came time to sit down and write, at the recommendation of my friend [Miles](http://mileszs.com/).

*"Sure,"* I thought. *"This works fine. Better than a folder full of disorganized and loosely connected text files. But I'll give one of the other apps a shot on the next story."*

Nope. Didn't happen. I'm still sticking with Evernote. It's got the feature set I want (easy to organize stories and groups of stories, cloud sync, accessible from any device I can log into) without the bloat of something like Scrivener. Protip: If I have to go through a 400-step tutorial to use your writing software, I am not going to use your writing software.

Ulysses is more light weight and seemed like a reasonable alternative, but I find it to be comparable in feature and usage to Evernote, so I don't have a compelling reason to switch.

**What I Read**

I spoke a bit about my writing system in my last post, but I haven't mentioned my reading system. In short, I want to read three books per month: one book on writing, one book on copywriting, and one book on marketing.

Here's what I read in January:

**[On Writing](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425703880&sr=1-1&keywords=on+writing)** by Stephen King

On Writing was a singular joy to read, and I wish I'd read it a decade ago. Stephen King is the reason I wanted to be an author as a child, and this book was the perfect combination of memoir and practical writing advice from a master of the genre. Bonus: tons of interesting insights into horror stories I read in high school, how he wrote them, where he was when he wrote them, and the impact they had on his family's lives.

**[Ogilvy on Advertising](http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425703914&sr=1-1&keywords=ogilvy+on+advertising)** by David Ogilvy

Ogilvy on Advertising and The Copywriter's Handbook were less enjoyable to read, but full of practical information. I was surprised to find Ogilvy on Advertising felt less dated than The Copywriter's Handbook, likely because Ogilvy focused less on specifics than Bly did. Ogilvy's relentless focus on provable, measureable results is fascinating. He was talking about data-driven marketing (a common enough practice in 2015) way back in the mid-1980s.

**[The Copywriter's Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Copywriters-Handbook-Step---Step-Writing/dp/0805078045/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425704153&sr=1-1&keywords=copywriter%27s+handbook)** by Robert Bly

The copy of The Copywriter's Handbook I read had a new section on writing for the web (this version was published in 2005 or so) and felt hilariously dated in 2015. Tons of mentions of "e-zines", for example, although the strategies Bly wrote about in 2005 still apply today (collecting emails, running drip campaigns, selling with benefits). Again, much like Ogilvy: work on something you can measure. Try new approaches, measure the results, get better over time. Solid, practical advice for any marketer.

A common thread I noticed in all three of these books is each writer takes a practical, craftsman-like approach to writing. These aren't flowery authors. They write about the "craft" of writing, not the "art", which appeals to me.

**Thoughts on My Systems**

One month in and I'm feeling good about these systems. I've gotten a lot more done in a single month than I typically do, and that persistent, nagging feeling that I should be using my spare time more productively has all but vanished.

I've already thought of ways to extend and improve these systems - bumping up my word count, for example, and keeping notes on the book I'm reading as I read it. This would help with summary blog posts at the end of the month, and I'd be able to talk about a book I read three weeks ago with more salient points than "It was good, I liked it".

Still, off to a good start. Feels good to talk about things I've done, not things I plan to do. I feel less pressure to keep a promise I've made.

If you're reading this and you've got book recommendations, writing tips or anything else you'd like to rap about, I'm all ears. You've been on the internet before. You know how to leave a comment on a blog post.
