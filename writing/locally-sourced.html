  <p>
  I hated going to the farmer’s market with my wife on Saturdays.
  </p>
  <p>
  But I loved my wife, so I went when she asked. We pulled into the gravel parking lot of the high school in the hip part of town. Ruth wandered the loop of the midtown farmer’s market, gasped over heirloom tomatoes, asked people if she could pet their dogs, and filled a canvas shopping bag with locally grown produce and cage free eggs. I followed close behind, and kept one eye on my wife so I wouldn’t bump into her while I checked my email on my phone.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Stop scowling, you turd,” she said, and jabbed me in the chest. I looked up to find Ruth glaring at me from behind huge round sunglasses. She tucked a strand of dark hair back behind her right ear, and adjusted the giant floppy hat she wore to keep the July sun at bay. Ruth frowned, but it was her friendly frown.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m not scowling, Ruth. I’m uh, enjoying this fine morning.” I slid my phone back into my pocket, then squinted and looked off in the distance. I pulled her underneath a nearby awning, out of the way of a hipster couple walking a great dane. An older woman behind a folding table covered in a blue gingham tablecloth smiled and pushed a jar of homemade pickles toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Bullshit. You are not, and you’re ruining it for me. Why’d you come with me if you’re just going to work on your stupid phone?” Ruth asked. She crossed her arms, and her frown became less friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Look, I put it away,” I said. “I had to respond to Jake on one little thing. He’s still not following the goddamn style guide."
  </p>
  <p>
  “I don’t give a shit about your style guide,” she said. "Why don’t you look around by yourself? Unless you want to go check out Rising Dawn’s delicious artisanal beets with me."
  </p>
  <p>
  I hated beets, artisanal or not, and she knew it.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sure, I’ll look around. Here, give me some sugar,” I said, and bent down for a kiss. She held her hat with both hands, puckered up dramatically, then crossed to the other side of the market to talk to a burly, red-faced woman about her beets. The pickle woman correctly identified me as a lost sale, and withdrew her jar.
  </p>
  <p>
  I walked around the crowded market, bumping into dogs, and looking at fresh organic produce with little interest. Most of the booths were crowded in spite of the early hour. People hurried across the dusty parking lot to buy farm fresh eggs and milk before the best vendors sold out. I spotted a small tent at the far end of the loop. An old man sat inside, and no one crowded in front of his tent. A young couple walking a german shepherd strolled past. The dog jerked away from the tent, wrapping his leash around his master’s legs and almost tripping the man.
  </p>
  <p>
  Papery yellow skin covered the old man’s sharp features. He wore a white button down shirt with a dark red tie. No hat. The other vendors wore hats. They were healthy people, with honest faces and big voices. This guy looked like a skeleton come to market.
  </p>
  <p>
  A large silver platter displaying greasy meat sat on the table next to an antique chafer. He kept a black leather bag on the ground, within easy reach next to his chair. The kind doctors carried in the old days. The old man’s head swiveled toward me when I entered his tent. His thin lips pressed together in a lizard's smile.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You don’t look like a farmer,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  His lips peeled apart and he flashed sharp, yellow teeth at me. It wasn’t exactly a smile.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No sir, I’m not,” he said, in a strange, croaking voice that carried a touch of the South. The old man leaned forward, and the table creaked under his weight, as if he was heavier than he looked.
  </p>
  <p>
  "I’m a butcher by trade. Have been for years. Wouldn’t be caught dead on a farm, if I'm honest.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The old man held out his left hand in greeting. His fingernails were long and dirty. Like he’d been digging. His palm was smooth, and his grip was strong.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m Ball,” he said. “Leroy Ball, at your service."
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m Jordan,” I said. “Nice to uh, meet you."
  </p>
  <p>
  He nodded, and shook my hand once. I resisted a sudden urge to wipe my hand on my pants. His eyes were a flat gray, and when he looked at me I was certain I’d done something wrong. Like I’d made a mistake, and he was a disappointed parent.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What kind of meat are you selling?” I asked. I didn’t recognize the smell. A fly buzzed around the meat and landed on a exposed bone. The old man didn’t try to shoo the insect away.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Pork, my friend. Rib meat today. Freshly butchered, and roasted just this morning. Locally sourced, cage free, and the best you’ll ever have, guaranteed! Can I treat you to a sample?"
  </p>
  <p>
  His pitch carried a momentum that eased the croak out of his voice, and the old man didn’t wait for me to answer. He grabbed a piece of meat by the bone, and held the sample toward me. His movement didn’t disturb the fly crawling along exposed bone on the platter of meat.
  </p>
  <p>
  He pressed his lips together again. Like he wanted to hide his teeth. I hesitated for a second or two, then accepted the rib.
  </p>
  <p>
  I almost spit the meat into the old man’s hand still hanging in the air. I thought I’d vomit onto the plate of meat, but my nausea passed quickly. The meat tasted rancid at first, but I felt compelled to take another bite, and another. I soon found myself gnawing on the bone, tearing bits of cartilage with my teeth. The old man wasn’t lying about the taste.
  </p>
  <p>
  Leroy Ball nodded and grinned. This time the smile seemed genuine. The skin around his eyes crinkled, like cracks in dry ground.
  </p>
  <p>
  “That’s right,” he said. “That’s just right."
  </p>
  <p>
  “You weren’t kidding,” I said. “I’ll take a pound."
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn’t want to make more small talk. I didn’t care if the pigs he butchered were pumped full of antibiotics, or how long his family had been in the butchering trade. I just wanted more of those ribs, and to get out of the old man’s sight.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I knew you would, son. That’ll be ten dollars, if you please,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  I licked my fingers clean while he rooted around in a cooler beneath the table. He pulled out a package wrapped in brown paper, and held out his hand to be paid.
  </p>
  <p>
  I fished a ten dollar bill out of my wallet, and took the brown paper package.
  </p>
  <p>
  “So long, son,” he said. He tipped an imaginary cap, and flashed his yellow teeth at me again.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You enjoy those ribs."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sure will. You uh, have a nice day."
  </p>
  <p>
  I found Ruth at the far end of the market, in front of a cage of rescue kittens brought in by a local shelter. She cooed at a tiny orange kitten, and stroked its head through the bars of the cage. Her canvas bag sat between her feet, full of produce.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh, you found something!” she said, and clapped her hands together in delight. “Here, I’ll trade you.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth bent down to pick up the heavy bag.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Nah, I got it. This isn’t very heavy,” I said, and took the bag from her.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You ready to go?” I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah,” she said. “Just let me say goodbye."
  </p>
  <p>
  She scratched the little cat a few more times between its ears, and we walked back through the crowd to the car.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  On the drive home, Ruth wanted to chat about the beets she bought, and the kitten she made friends with. As I drove, I sucked on my teeth and I could still taste that heavy, salty flavor. I mentally sorted a list of ideas for cooking the meat until I pulled into our driveway.
  </p>
  <p>
  I helped Ruth unpack the groceries, then looked for recipes online. I settled on a slow roast method using minimal spices.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth always did the week’s laundry in the basement after we got home from the farmer’s market on Saturdays. She walked past the open door of my office, lugging a white basket full of clothes, and I got started in the kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
  The meat glistened beneath the track lighting in our kitchen when I unwrapped the brown paper package. I could picture myself tearing into the raw meat, cracking open the bones to get at the sweet marrow inside. My mouth watered as I lined a baking sheet with aluminum foil, then placed both racks side by side on the sheet.
  </p>
  <p>
  A steady thumping noise from the basement interrupted me just as I was opening the oven door.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Babe, can you give me a hand down here? The washer’s fucked up again,” called Ruth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ugh, goddammit,” I muttered. I set a timer on the oven for 4 hours.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sure, be right down,” I called.
  </p>
  <p>
  The stairs creaked under my weight. The washer had moved half a foot away from the concrete wall. Ruth stood next to the machine, hands on her hips. It wasn’t the first time we’d had this problem.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Here, see if you can find that foot,” I said. I bent down and picked up the machine from the right corner.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Aha, there it is,” I said. “Can you put it back in place?” Ruth bent and grabbed a little rubber foot, then reattached it to the underside of the washer.
  </p>
  <p>
  “One of these days, we’ll have to actually get this thing fixed,” I said. I settled the machine back onto the concrete floor, and moved the clothes inside to more evenly distribute the weight.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth frowned, and waved a hand in front of her face.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What’s that smell? Are you cooking something?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh, yeah,” I said. “The ribs I bought. They’ll be ready in a few hours, if you want some."
  </p>
  <p>
  “You never cook anything,” she said. The look on her face told me no, she would not want some. Her loss.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, I do today. I’m gonna get some work done. You need a hand with anything else?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, that should do it,” she said. Ruth slapped me on the ass, and craned her neck up for a kiss.
  </p>
  <p>
  I headed back upstairs to distract myself with work while I waited for the ribs to cook.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  Four hours later, I put both racks on a serving platter with barbecue sauce on the side, and sat down to enjoy my feast.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth watched me eat from the kitchen doorway of the kitchen, arms crossed and nose wrinkled.
  </p>
  <p>
  “So how are they?” she asked.
  </p>
  <p>
  I put down the second rack of ribs, and licked my fingers clean.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh my god, baby. I take back every bad thing I ever said about the farmer’s market."
  </p>
  <p>
  “They don’t smell right,” she said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I think they smell great,” I said. “And they taste even better. You want to try a bit?"
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth nodded and I handed her a loose rib. She sniffed the meat, then tore off a tiny piece with her teeth. She chewed for a moment, then her eyes widened, and she covered her mouth with her hand. Ruth shook her head and handed the bone back to me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “That is not for me,” she said. “Oh god, I think I’m gonna be sick."
  </p>
  <p>
  She headed down the hallway to the bathroom, shutting the door behind her. She turned on the sink, and retched into the toilet. Ruth didn’t usually react this way to food. I was the picky one in the family.
  </p>
  <p>
  I scraped the rib Ruth didn’t finish clean with my teeth, then tapped on the bathroom door.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Baby, you ok?” I asked. Ruth’s hair was damp and plastered to her forehead. Her face was pale, except for a high spot of bright red on each cheek.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, I’m ok. Feeling better, anyway. Thought I was really going to be sick for a minute."
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m glad you’re alright. And look on the bright side! More for me,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth rolled her eyes, and didn’t laugh at my joke.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  That night, I tossed and turned, sweat trickling down my temples in spite of the air conditioning. My stomach didn’t exactly hurt, but it felt wrong. I licked salt from my lips in the stifling darkness of our bedroom, and touched my face. The skin covering my cheeks felt too tight.
  </p>
  <p>
  Next to me, Ruth slept curled on her left side with her hand on her stomach. I pulled my pillow over my ears to block out her soft, shallow breathing, and still the steady rise and fall of my wife’s breath kept me awake.
  </p>
  <p>
  I sat up and counted the tick of her heart by the slow pulse in her neck. I wished I hadn’t eaten all the ribs.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  In the morning, I felt fine. The feverish, sleepless night felt like someone else’s dream. Bacon sizzled in the kitchen, the smell drifting through our open bedroom door. My own cooking skills had atrophied after Ruth and I got married. I could boil eggs or make a decent sandwich, but the ribs I roasted the day before represented a lifetime culinary achievement.
  </p>
  <p>
  I swung my legs over the bed and gagged on the smell of the bacon as I stumbled down the hall toward the kitchen. My legs were loose and uncooperative. I paused just outside the bathroom and steadied myself against the wall.
  </p>
  <p>
  “There aren’t any farmer’s markets on Sundays, are there?” I asked, and took a cautious sip from a mug of coffee Ruth left on the table for me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Not that I know of. They’re mostly a Saturday thing. Why?” she asked. Ruth was chopping peeled kiwis, and she paused to look at me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Been thinking about those ribs since last night. I was wondering if I could catch that guy and buy more for this week."
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth raised a disbelieving eyebrow. I worked from home, and I usually went out for lunch or had something delivered.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You could cook something else, you know,” she said. “Those things stunk up the house.”
  </p>
  <p>
  She scraped the fruit into a bowl and placed it in the center of the table. I popped a sliced kiwi into my mouth. I circled the slimy thing with my tongue. It felt wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth brought two plates full of gray eggs and greasy bacon to the table. I heard the whine of insect wings, and searched near the kitchen lights for a fly.
  </p>
  <p>
  "Do you know the farm he was from? You might be able to find it online and see the other markets he visits."
  </p>
  <p>
  I shook my head, and speared an egg with my fork. The egg jiggled and leaked fluid that mixed with bacon grease.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, he said he wasn’t a farmer. He’s a butcher. I figured he was from a local place, but didn’t ask where."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Mm, you should’ve asked. He’ll probably be there again this week. I guess you’ll just have to suffer through until then."
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  Everything I ate the following week tasted like ashes in my mouth. Like dirt. At our traditional Sunday brunch, I choked down thick sliced bacon and toasted artisanal bread with homemade fig jam. The bacon was cage freel and came from Smiling Pig farms, and it was all I could do not to spit it out on my plate.
  </p>
  <p>
  I couldn’t find anything online about the butcher. There were no photos of him with the other vendors on the local farmer’s markets websites, and no information about his delicious pork ribs. I didn’t expect him to use Twitter or Facebook, but I checked anyway. Nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
  Local butchers and slaughterhouses were dead ends. Ruth told me about a little German butcher shop downtown, and I drove there on Wednesday. “Klem’s Meat Market” was painted in red letters at the top of a large display window full of ropes of sausages and smoked meat. I parked across the street, and opened a door beneath a striped red and white awning.
  </p>
  <p>
  A little bell above the door jingled. A broad man man wearing a neatly trimmed beard stood behind a glass counter full of flat, gray meat. He spread his arms wide in welcome when I entered his store.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Welcome, welcome!” he said. “What can I do for you?" His voice was big, healthy. Intrusive.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Hi there. Uh, nice place,” I said. “I’m looking for somebody, and I was hoping you could help.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn’t know if I was talking to Klem, but I thought of him as Klem. He leaned forward on the counter and cocked his head to the side.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m looking for another local butcher. I haven’t been able to find anything about him."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sure, sure. I know him,” he said, and nodded with enthusiasm.
  </p>
  <p>
  I described the old man who sold me the ribs. What he looked like, where I met him, and what he sold me. Klem rose and backed away when I described the old yellow man. He crossed his arms over his clean white apron, and shook his head. Another no.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I don’t know this man. I can’t help,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Damn. Well, thanks for your time. Have a good one!” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  I felt Klem watching me until I crossed the street. He glared at me until I drove out of sight of his display window, heading north on my way back home.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  Somehow I made it through the rest of the week, getting less sleep every night. I spent hours online trying to track down the old man. I visited stores specializing in locally sourced, cage free meat. I called slaughter houses in the area. Nothing. No one had heard of the old butcher.
  </p>
  <p>
  I figured my best chance was to catch him at the farmer’s market on Saturday. I was already out of bed and trying to distract myself with work when Ruth walked into my office.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You’re up early,” she said. She yawned and leaned down for a kiss.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, couldn’t sleep again. You ready for the farmer’s market?"
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth snorted.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Baby, I just got up, and you hate the market. We’ll probably head there in a couple hours."
  </p>
  <p>
  I never could hide my impatience from Ruth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ugh, it’s that goddamn meat, isn’t it?” she said. “The market doesn’t even open until 8. But I’ll start getting ready."
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I leaped out of the car when we pulled into the gravel parking lot, and scanned the farmers setting up their tents. I didn’t see the old man. I gave Ruth a hasty smooch, and took off toward the end of the loop.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Uh, bye!” she called after me.
  </p>
  <p>
  I hoped to see his grizzled face beneath his faded yellow awning, waiting patiently behind his folding table. The spot at the end of the loop was empty. No tent, no folding table. Nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
  A large man in the space next to the end of the loop was unpacking a box of early apples, and stacking them neatly on a table. He wore a straw hat. The kind most of the big, healthy farmers wore.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Excuse me,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Hi there. What can I do for you?" He squinted, hands on his hips, and turned his big, honest face toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Do you know the vendor who was here last week?” I asked, pointing at the empty space. “He’s a butcher. Older guy, sells pork ribs?"
  </p>
  <p>
  The man shook his head.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No sir, doesn’t ring a bell. I’m not here every week, though. Some of the other vendors might know him."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Thanks, I’ll ask around."
  </p>
  <p>
  He nodded and went back to stacking his apples.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  “Lots of vendors only come once or twice a market,” said a young woman wearing a t-shirt with a cartoon pig licking its chops. “We sell pork, though! Cage free, no antibiotics. You want to try some?” she asked, and pulled a metal cover off a plate.
  </p>
  <p>
  Rubbery gray meat lay in a congealing pool of grease. I wrinkled my nose at the stench of it.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No thanks,” I said. “I’m not hungry."
  </p>
  <p>
  She frowned, just for a moment, then cocked her head to the side and grinned at me. Her braid slid off her shoulder with the movement, exposing her neck. A dark blue vein traced her neck up toward her jawline.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh. Well, ok!” she chirped. “We’re Smiling Pig farm. Keep us in mind if you uh, change your mind!"
  </p>
  <p>
  The combination of the morning market noise and early sun started to give me a headache. I stumbled as I pushed my way through the crowd. I couldn’t remember the last time I ate real food, and something close to panic grew in my stomach as I made my way through the market, talking to every vendor. Every big, healthy farmer.
  </p>
  <p>
  I got a lot of blank looks and earnest apologies. No one had any idea where the old man came from, where he worked, or where he’d gone.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth appeared out of the crowd with her canvas shopping bag hanging limply at her side.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Any luck?” she asked.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, he’s not here,” I said. I massaged my forehead, trying to coax the headache away. The nonsense babble of the crowd around us rose and fell.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It’s weird. Like no one even remembers him being here.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “That is weird,” she said. “These markets are usually pretty close. You could try some of the other markets. There’s the one on the north side, and the one downtown, in that old church parking lot."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, I might go back out later. You still shopping?” I asked. Her bag seemed barely half full.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Nah, I’m ready if you are. I don’t feel that great, and most of the stuff didn’t look exceptional to me today."
  </p>
  <p>
  “I feel like shit, too,” I said. “Got a headache."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Let’s just go home,” she said. “I feel like a nap."
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I dropped Ruth off at home and went back out looking for the old man.
  </p>
  <p>
  The north side market was held in a renovated barn on a local organic dairy farm. It wasn’t as crowded as the midtown farmer’s market, but I got the same result. No one had heard of the old man. No one had seen him. Every big, honest farmer I spoke to was eager to recommend an alternate butcher. A friend of theirs, or someone they bought organic pork from every week. They all wanted me to sample their crisp early apples, or their late asparagus, or their beautiful curly kale.
  </p>
  <p>
  I drove back up the winding driveway, over a metal grate that kept the cows from wandering out onto the road running past the farm. I had one last market to check.
  </p>
  <p>
  I spent half an hour on the interstate to get downtown. My eyes watered and my throat burned as I pulled into a black asphalt parking lot ringed with a handful of awnings and tents. I counted 9 in total, and I didn’t have much hope anyone there would be able to help.
  </p>
  <p>
  The last vendor I spoke to was an old woman in a sagging lawn chair behind a table full of large, flat sugar cookies wrapped in clear plastic. She wore a man’s plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up, exposing stick thin arms. The old woman leaned forward in the chair, thin iron gray hair pulled into a bun, bony knuckles wrapped around the curved head of a cane. She shook her head when I asked about the butcher.
  </p>
  <p>
  I thanked her, and turned to leave.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I know him, but I ain’t seen him in years,” she said. Her voice was throaty and raw. A gift received from a lifetime of smoking. The old woman’s right eye was cloudy with a cataract, but her left eye was an unsettling blue.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I didn’t like him then, and I’m glad I ain’t seen him,” she said. “He tried to buddy up to my husband, Paul. Sold him some of that pork meat, too."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Is your husband here? I’d like to talk to him, if I could."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Dead,” she said. Her hands tightened and twisted around the handle of the cane. She covered a large, ugly scar on the back of her right hand.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m sorry to hear that,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  I bought a cookie and paid for it with a wrinkled bill I fished out of my pocket.
  </p>
  <p>
  Her lips pressed together until her mouth was a bloodless cut. Like she was trying to keep herself from saying something she shouldn’t say.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I came home in a foul mood. Ruth gave me some time to stew by myself in my office. Half an hour later, I heard a soft knock on the door as it swung open.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No luck?” she asked, standing in the doorway.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ugh, no,” I said, and turned around in my chair. “It’s fucking annoying. And I know it’s stupid, but god DAMN, I just wish I could find this guy.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I clenched my fists, and my fingernails dug into the skin of my palms.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You don’t deal well with frustration, you know,” she chided. Ruth smiled and batted her eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh, believe me. I am well aware,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, I know it’s no mystery meat from some random dude at the farmer’s market, but I’m making lamb stew. Should be ready around 5. Sound good?"
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth’s lamb stew was one of my absolute favorites.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah,” I said. “That sounds really good, baby."
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth ignored the lie and leaned down for a smooch.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’ll let you get some work done,” she said.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn’t get any work done that day. I’d barely gotten any work done all week. No one on my team had said anything yet, but I was off.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth and I ate in silence. The stew was fine. It was perfectly reasonable lamb stew, but it wasn’t what I wanted. My skin crawled under the track lighting in our kitchen, and my tongue seemed to shrink away from every bite, reluctant even to taste the stew.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
  I couldn’t remember the last time I’d gotten more than a couple hours at night. I laid awake in bed that night, listening to Ruth’s soft breath. I watched the rise and fall of her chest.
  </p>
  <p>
  Sometimes you come to a conclusion that rings so true there’s no denying it. I had one of these around three in the morning, as I laid awake watching my wife sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’d eaten human flesh.
  </p>
  <p>
  The old man hadn’t sold me pork ribs. The events over the last week suddenly made sense. My initial revulsion to the sample at the farmer’s market. Klem’s refusal to speak to me. The old woman’s cryptic warning in the church parking lot.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was a cannibal, and the realization was freeing. That tight, panicky feeling in my stomach drifted away. I’d been dealing with a problem I couldn’t solve all week, and nothing is more maddening than a problem I can’t solve. A solution presented itself as I lay tangled in our bed sheets, sweat dripping down my temples.
  </p>
  <p>
  I watched the pulse in Ruth’s neck. I watched it for a long, long time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Before I finally fell asleep that night, I’d started planning to kill and eat my lovely wife.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn’t feel different when I woke Sunday morning. I was already a cannibal. The leap to murderer didn’t seem like much of a leap. The thought of killing and eating my beautiful, supportive wife of 5 years was harder to wrap my head around, but I got there.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’d read cannibal stories on the internet. Maybe those people talked to the old man. Maybe they were driven mad with hunger, too.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth stood in front of the stove, scrambling eggs for our Sunday brunch in a cast iron skillet. Our last Sunday brunch. I’d try to enjoy it.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Hey there,” she said, and smiled.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Morning, baby,” I said. I grabbed a carafe of cold brewed coffee from the fridge and kissed Ruth on her neck. My mouth watered at the taste of salt on her skin. I poured a cup of coffee and sat down as Ruth placed my plate on the table in front of me.
  </p>
  <p>
  I used to love Ruth’s eggs. I held my breath to avoid breathing in the stink of them.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Are you all right?” she asked, and furrowed her brow. “You don’t look so hot."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, I’m ok. Just didn’t sleep much last night. Thinking about a problem at work,” I said. I tried to believe the lie myself and poked at my eggs with a fork.
  </p>
  <p>
  The scrape of Ruth’s fork on her plate was too loud.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, I’m going to do the laundry in a bit. You should take a nap after breakfast,” she said. Ruth punctuated her command by pointing at me with her fork.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yes, mommmm,” I said. This was a favorite joke of ours, and we laughed together. It felt like old times. Like nothing had changed.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I stared at the computer screen in my office. I hadn’t formed much of a plan to kill Ruth, let alone how to prepare her body. Prepare. The word crawled across my mind, and my tongue scraped against the rough backside of my teeth as I browsed unsavory websites in a private window.
  </p>
  <p>
  The enormity of what I was attempting to plan dawned on me. I swallowed once, hard, as a loud, arrhythmic thumping came from the basement.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ahh fuck,” yelled Ruth. “Babe, can you come down here? The washer’s broken again."
  </p>
  <p>
  The taste of ashes lay heavy my tongue, and I swallowed again.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, be right down,” I called. I paused at the hall closet long enough to grab a claw hammer. The old wooden steps creaked under my weight  and I held the hammer close against my right thigh to hide it from Ruth.
  </p>
  <p>
  The washer was in its usual place. A large sheet of plastic covered most of the concrete floor, spread over the drain in the center of the room. I didn’t see Ruth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ruth?” I called, and stepped onto the floor of the basement. I felt a sting in my neck, and the hammer slipped from my hand.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  When I woke, I was lying naked and cold on the plastic sheet. Ruth stood in the corner behind the stairs, hand covering her mouth. The way she did when she was trying not to cry, or when something was really funny. Tears rolled down her cheeks. With great effort, I could move my neck a little. The hammer lay on top of my clothes, sitting on a chair next to the washing machine.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Mnngdh,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m sorry, baby,” she said. Ruth’s voice was smaller than a whisper. A delicate little thing. “I am. But I had the meat too, and when you couldn’t find more, I just…kind of went crazy for it."
  </p>
  <p>
  She didn’t have to explain. I understood completely.
  </p>
  <p>
  The stairs groaned above me. Ruth’s eyes widened, and her hand clenched around her jaw. I didn’t have the strength to roll my head to greet the person walking down my basement stairs, but I knew who it was.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Evening, young man,” said the butcher. He loomed above me, black doctor’s bag dangling from his left hand. The old man’s head eclipsed the bare light bulb in the rafter above me, and my flesh broke out in goose bumps when his shadow fell on me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I understand you’ve been looking for me. I must apologize. I’ve been away these past few weeks. On business."
  </p>
  <p>
  He stepped over me and put his bag on top of the washing machine. Ruth shrank from him, but her eyes never left my face. Her hand peeled away from her mouth, and she licked her lips when the butcher removed a large bone saw from his bag.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Now then, my dear,” he said. “Shall we get started?"
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruth licked her lips once more, and nodded.
