  <h1><small id="small-header">The Rabbit</small></h1>
  <p>
  It started with the rabbit. It cowered on the floor of the cage that enclosed the exit loop of Dr. Stack’s teleportation device. Quivering, shitting itself, guts on the outside of its body. The little thing looked at me with enormous, wet eyes, spasmed, and died. The loop hummed with strange energy, a sick yellow glow spilling over the fur and glistening intestines of the dead rabbit. The machine whined, a sound pitching up and up that faded when the doctor tapped his password into his computer and closed the circuit. The glow in the center of the loop rippled like a piece of cloth and winked out.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well,” said Dr. Stack. “That wasn’t supposed to happen."
  </p>
  <p>
  I was a research assistant working with the doctor on his instantaneous travel project. I was the only applicant with a biology background. His students and teaching assistants were eager to work with him, and he built up a stack of computer scientists an inch and a half thick. But Dr. Stack didn't need a computer scientist. He didn’t need an eager to please student, hoping to further his own robotics or engineering career. He needed someone who understood how living things worked.
  </p>
  <p>
  Dr. Stack's work was well-known, even in the biology department, but none of my fellow students had thought to apply. I saw an opportunity. I figured working with Dr. Stack would be a resume builder.
  </p>
  <p>
  I got the job, and started in the late spring after signing numerous NDAs and other legal forms.
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor explained the teleportation process on my first day in the lab, while he helped me set up my work stations. The machine worked much like teleportation devices in old sci-fi movies. A subject entered one loop, the machine broke the subject down to the atomic level, and reassembled the subject at the other loop.
  </p>
  <p>
  That explanation was enough for me. I grew up on Star Trek, and I didn’t need more than a rough understanding of how the device worked to do my job. I was here to take care of the rabbits, make sure they were comfortable and healthy, and analyze any specimens that came back. Even if they came back in pieces. Like our first live subject.
  </p>
  <p>
  I poked B1-R0 with my finger. White fur slid around beneath my short fingernail. Too loose. I drew upon years of scientific training to cooly assess the situation.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It’s dead, Jim,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Thank you, Sarah,” he said. Everyone else I knew called me “Murphy” or “Murph.” But not Dr. Stack. I tried telling him only my grandma called me “Sarah.” It didn't take.
  </p>
  <p>
  He bent over his desk, scribbling in his leather notebook. His hand moved faster and faster across the page, until he slammed the leather cover shut and stood, cracking his back and grimacing.
  </p>
  <p>
  The prototype device took up most of the center of the lab. Two metal loops separated by 30 feet of bare concrete floor, taped to a pair of folding tables. Wires snaked across the floor, connecting the loops to large machines used to run the experiments.
  </p>
  <p>
  Getting something through the rings wasn’t our current problem. We sorted that one out, more or less. It was simple enough to put something through one loop, transmit it thirty feet, and receive it through the exit loop. Our current problem was getting the same output. Even inorganic material didn’t make the trip unchanged.
  </p>
  <p>
  We spent weeks on inorganic trials. A glass bowl. A rock. A pencil. Each came through with minor changes. The glass edge of the bowl was thicker, and the bowl lacked the fine detail it had when I pushed it into the entrance loop. The rock was a different shade of gray. The doctor didn’t notice the change in the rock’s coloration. But he didn’t argue when we weighed the rock, and found it two kilograms heavier. The pencil was mostly eraser material when it returned.
  </p>
  <p>
  He updated the algorithms that operated the machine after every attempt. Countless minor adjustments after dozens of trials with rocks, sticks, blocks of wood, and plastic bowls. Plastic was the hardest, but we got closer with every attempt. Eventually a rock came out of the exit loop more or less the same. Maybe a few differences. A slight change in color, or weight, or texture. These irregularities were due to bad interpretation, according to the doctor. A minor bug in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
  Failed recombination made sense. It explained why rocks came through slightly heavier, or a different shade of gray. Eventually we got inorganic material sorted out. More or less.
  </p>
  <p>
  We moved on to live subjects at the doctor’s insistence. Sooner than we should have, in my opinion, given our inconsistent results from inorganic material, but I wasn’t in a position to argue. And now I had a dead rabbit to clean up.
  </p>
  <p>
  I scraped the remains of B1-R0 into a large plastic bag. Identifying each test subject was imperative, and we needed an easy way to refer to each rabbit in our notes. I didn’t want to tag the rabbits with spray paint or a marker. Plastic tags were right out. We had enough trouble with plastic by itself. Introducing more variables to account for was a Bad Idea.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was in charge of numbering the rabbits, and tagging them correctly when they came out of the exit loop. Each rabbit got a batch number, based on its current group of ten, and an id number, based on its position in the queue. The numbers went into Doctor Stack’s notes, and onto the outside of the bags when the subject came through the exit loop. The rabbits were numbered from 0 to 9.
  </p>
  <p>
  I made sure the heavy bag was sealed, then wrote B1-R0 on the outside of the plastic bag with black marker. Poor little Rabbit Zero. I would perform an autopsy, and then freeze its remains for later study. Finally, a chance to use my biology training. I almost couldn’t wait to poke through loops of reeking intestines.
  </p>
  <p>
  I held the bloody bag of dead rabbit up to the light, and the doctor's face was distorted through gore-streaked plastic. The sight bothered me, so I lowered the bag. Fluorescent lighting reflected off a greasy sheen over the lenses of Doctor Stack’s glasses. His glasses were filthy, and his hair stood on end. I didn't know how long he’d been awake.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I still don’t think we’re ready for organic trials,” I said. “And I’m pretty sure I’ve seen movies about what we’re doing here."
  </p>
  <p>
  “I value your jokes, Sarah,” he said. “What the heck. What the actual heck. We got inorganic material sorted out, right?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “More or less,” I said. “Inorganics come back mostly the same. Nothing like this."
  </p>
  <p>
  I shook the heavy plastic bag. The little thing’s front leg flopped bonelessly, and its eye swiveled toward me. Glaring. I turned the bag around so I wouldn’t have to look at it.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Organic trials are the next logical step, Sarah,” he said. Dr. Stack chopped the air in front of him as he spoke. Like he was describing a process. “We’re close enough with inorganic material, and there are bound to be bugs."
  </p>
  <p>
  Pieces of subject B1-R0 were smeared across the floor of the cage. I wondered if the doctor was racing against someone else. Someone working on a similar project. A former colleague, or some other mad scientist.
  </p>
  <p>
  "Bugs," I repeated.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’ll make more adjustments. This run has given me an idea,” he said. “Can you put on some more coffee? Probably going to be a long night.” Doctor Stack didn’t wait for me to answer. He rolled his desk chair across the floor, and typed in his password on his laptop.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sure,” I said. I set the bag aside for later study. I washed my hands again, then put on another pot of coffee.
  </p>
  <p>
  They were all long nights, in those days.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  Over the next 13 weeks, Dr. Stack relied on my expert opinion every time a rabbit came through with its guts on the outside of its body, or missing its skin, or with too many legs.
  </p>
  <p>
  More bad interpretation. Failed recombination explained why rabbits came out with extra limbs, split in two, or dragging mangled, fleshy lumps behind them. Bugs in the code leading to bad interpretation leading to a bloody mess on the floor of the cage surrounding the exit loop.
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor made a lot of adjustments, but there were a lot of dead rabbits to analyze. I pushed each subject through the entrance loop, and each returned inside out, crawling with tentacles, or covered in foul-smelling tumors. Most of the rabbits that survived didn’t live long. I brought my mother’s spade into the lab after one rabbit squeezed itself through the door to the containment cage and crawled around the lab, shrieking and dragging most of its lower body behind it. I kept the spade in a corner near the exit loop. Just in case.
  </p>
  <p>
  I named some of the rabbits based on their batch numbers. B4-R1 was Barry. B3-R7 was Bert. I’m not sure if this changed how I treated the rabbits I named. I may have been gentler when I pushed Bert through the entrance loop than I was with B2-R8.
  </p>
  <p>
  A private animal dealer delivered rabbits to us in groups of ten. Every other Monday we had ten fresh new rabbits in the cages lining the far wall of the lab. Enough subjects for two weeks of organic trials. Dr. Stack and I often worked on weekends, but we only ran experiments through the week. The rest of our time was divided between analysis, tweaking the algorithms that ran the device, and cleaning up failed experiments.
  </p>
  <p>
  Dr. Stack was a theoretical physicist, computer scientist, and mathematician. He collaborated with a colleague of his on the physical design of the device, and fabrication was farmed out. He was big into secrecy, and didn’t give up much information about the project. Still, I asked once in a while. Usually when I started feeling weird about the work. Work I couldn’t tell anyone about, thanks to numerous NDAs. Not if I wanted to have a career in science one day.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  We went through 64 rabbits before the doctor got it right. We got lucky in week 13, or so I thought at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Subject B6-R4 was our survivor. I placed him in the cage surrounding the entrance loop, and Doctor Stack gave a thumbs up from the control station. I felt the hum in my bones before the loop came to life. The rabbit’s ears swiveled toward the dim yellow light. As if he was listening to something. B6-R4 pawed the air once, and hopped through the center of the loop. He didn’t need any coaxing. No gentle push.
  </p>
  <p>
  I rushed to the other side of the lab, tugging on a pair of heavy yellow rubber gloves. The spade waited for me in the corner. I was prepared to clean up any mess, or kill any horror that came through.
  </p>
  <p>
  A few seconds later B6-R4, aka Big Ra, hopped out of the pale yellow light in the center of the exit loop. The light seemed to cling to Big Ra’s fur, as if he was emerging through a thin membrane. The rabbit had no missing eyeballs, or extra eyeballs. Big Ra dragged no gargantuan, bleeding ulcer behind him. There were no strange appendages scrabbling at the wire bars of the cage containing the exit loop. He returned from his trip across the lab safe, sound, and whole.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Holy shit,” I said. Doctor Stack's jaw hung open, coffee stains visible on his teeth. He closed his mouth and shook his head.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Quick, Sarah. Grab him!"
  </p>
  <p>
  I eased the door to the wire cage open, but I didn’t have to be quick. Big Ra was easy to catch. I knew not to make any sudden moves, but the rabbit didn’t jump at my throat, shoot needles out of his mouth, or explode. He cowered in the center of the cage, ears close to his skull. He was timid as you please as I reached toward him. The rabbit shivered in my arms when I picked him up, and buried his face in the crook of my elbow.
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor scribbled furiously in his notebook, barking commands.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok, put him in quarantine. I want samples. And get the camera on him. I want to make sure this isn’t another B2-R8."
  </p>
  <p>
  Ugh, B2-R8. What a nightmare.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You got it,” I said. Quarantine was a glass-walled room in a corner of the lab, next to the row of rabbit cages. We kept a single wire cage on a metal table in the center of the room. None of the other rabbits had survived long enough for continued study. I held Big Ra with one arm, opened the glass door to the room, and unlatched the wire cage. I placed him in the cage, and turned on a camera in a corner of the small room.
  </p>
  <p>
  “There you go, Big Ra,” I said. “Safe and sound. Welcome home."
  </p>
  <p>
  I picked up an empty syringe from a metal tray in another corner of the room, held Big Ra by the scruff of his neck, and drew a blood sample. I put the sample back on the tray, and picked up a second needle. This one was for a tissue sample. The rabbit squirmed when this one went in. I didn’t blame the little guy.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Shh, buddy. I know,” I said. The rabbit would not be soothed. He shook his head from side to side.
  </p>
  <p>
  “There we go, all done,” I said. Big Ra shot to the far corner of the cage when I let go of him. I sealed the samples, and adjusted the angle of the camera before latching the cage once more. The rabbit glared at me until I closed the hermetically sealed door behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
  Dr. Stack didn’t look up as I approached. His journal lay open before him, and he glanced at his computer while he wrote.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Any notable changes?” he asked.
  </p>
  <p>
  “None that I could see,” I said. “He seems rabbit-like. The feed should be streaming.” I opened my laptop and brought up the camera's feed. Big Ra was drinking water from a bottle.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yep, there he is. Still seems fine. I drew blood and took a tissue sample. I’ll take a look at those now."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Good, good,” he said. Dr. Stack turned around in his chair, and wiped his glasses on a handkerchief. His glasses were covered in greasy fingerprints and smudges no matter how often he cleaned them.
  </p>
  <p>
  “This is big, Sarah,” he said. He raised a skinny fist in the air. I’d worked with him for six months, mostly afternoons, evenings, and weekends. I’d never seen him this excited. The doctor may as well have been turning cartwheels around the lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Looks like the last changes did the trick,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  He nodded several times in a row, quick, emphatic jerks, then leaned forward in front of his laptop. He placed that skinny fist in the palm of his other hand, and rested his chin on top.
  </p>
  <p>
  “There you are,” he said, whispering to the video feed. Like a proud parent. “Safe and sound."
  </p>
  <p>
  I kept a desk with a microscope in the corner opposite the quarantine area. The flesh sample would have to be fixed, and wouldn’t be ready for at least six hours. I looked at my phone. It was already close to 9pm. Definitely a job for tomorrow.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’ll prepare the samples,” I said. “I can look at his blood today, but the tissue sample will have to wait until tomorrow."
  </p>
  <p>
  The blood slide took a moment to air dry before I stained it. I set both slides on the desk, and returned to my laptop to work through the day’s notes.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  “There’s a problem,” I said. Dr. Stack’s chair rolled backwards across the floor and bumped into a filing cabinet.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What problem?” he asked. He stood close behind me, hands on his hips with his head cocked to the side.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It looks like an infection,” I said, and stood so he could take my seat. The doctor peered into the microscope and adjusted the view.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, sure does,” he said. “And you tested it before we sent it through?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yep. Nothing before he went through. Just regular, boring, rabbit blood."
  </p>
  <p>
  In the far corner of the lab, Big Ra swiveled his head toward us, and twitched one ear.
  </p>
  <p>
  “And he doesn’t seem unusual in any way?” asked the doctor.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Nope,” I said. “No heavy breathing, no obvious signs of distress. But I’m not a vet.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, let's keep him in quarantine for now. I’ll keep the camera running through the night. Check his blood again tomorrow.” He sat back down in his old leather chair while I packed up for the day. It was late, and I was tired. Still, a victory deserved a celebration.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We ought to celebrate, you know,” I said. "You want to grab a drink, or something?”
  </p>
  <p>
  “No thank you, Sarah. I’ll be here late tonight, I think. I have a lot of work to finish before the conference."
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor was speaking at a conference in a little over a week. Suddenly his insistence in stepping up our timetable made more sense.
  </p>
  <p>
  “All right. I’m heading home. I’ll be back in the morning."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sounds good. Nice work today, by the way,” he said. He looked up from his journal. Fluorescent light glinted off his smudged glasses. “Really. I couldn’t have come this far without you."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Thanks,” I said. “We’re making good progress, I think. Ok, I’ll see you in the morning."
  </p>
  <p>
  Dr. Stack gave me another thumbs up, then lowered his head.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  We kept Big Ra in quarantine for a week. Blood tests on his second and third days back home indicated increasing signs of infection. He displayed a decreased appetite and drank less water than usual. Otherwise, the rabbit seemed fine.
  </p>
  <p>
  All signs of infection were cleared on the fourth day, but I continued checking every morning. His blood was still clean on days five, six, and seven.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Looks like he’s cleared that infection,” I said on Big Ra’s seventh day back. There was no response from the doctor. Dr. Stacks’ voice carried through the closed door. He paced up and down the hallway outside the lab, talking on the phone. He spent a lot more time on the phone after Big Ra returned from his trip.
  </p>
  <p>
  A week in quarantine was standard procedure for any surviving subject, and it was time to put Big Ra back with the other rabbits.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Let’s get you back home, Big Ra,” I said, and opened the door to his cage. Big Ra hopped toward me, crouching with his head close to the ground. He came easily into my arms, and snuggled once more into the crook of my elbow.
  </p>
  <p>
  Big Ra’s neighbor B6-R5’s eyes widened as I approached, and the little animal shrieked. The sharp sound echoed in the quiet lab. The rabbit shivered in the rear corner of his cage, pressing himself against the wall.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What’s wrong, buddy? It’s ok,” I said. I closed the door to Big Ra's cage, and moved the camera to get a wide angle view of both cages. I wanted to keep an eye on Big Ra now that he was back in general population. Just in case.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  My duties as Dr. Stack’s research assistant included preparing the lab for daily experiments. This meant making sure the machines were ready to go, the equipment was organized, and the subjects were comfortable, fed, and watered. I cleaned up a lot of rabbit shit.
  </p>
  <p>
  The day after I put Big Ra back with the other rabbits, I came in to replace the bedding in the cages, and found B6-R5’s cage empty.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Huh,” I said. I stopped in front of Big Ra’s cage, and put the container of EZ-Straw I was carrying on the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Where’d your buddy go, Big Ra?”
  </p>
  <p>
  Big Ra didn’t respond.
  </p>
  <p>
  The door to the empty cage was closed, and I caught a whiff of something like ozone. There was a single drop of blood on the side of the missing rabbit’s water bottle. Maybe the size of a dime. I scraped at it with my thumbnail. The blood had congealed, but wasn’t yet fully dry. A few hours old, at most.
  </p>
  <p>
  I pressed the playback button on the back of the camera, but nothing happened. I pressed harder, as if more pressure would convince the thing to wake up. No luck.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Shit,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  I scoured the lab, looking under desks, and in any nook that might hide an escaped rabbit. Nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
  I fed the remaining rabbits, topped off their water, and replaced their dirty bedding. Once I was done, I sat down to go through the previous day’s notes. The camera was dead, and the last recorded feed was from the previous night. No record of what happened to the missing rabbit.
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor arrived about an hour later. He wasn’t concerned about the missing rabbit, but the missing footage got under his skin.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, what the heck,” he said, running a hand through his hair and pacing. “It’s just gone? Like it didn’t record?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yes,” I said. “No footage was recorded last night. And there’s no sign of the escapee. I found a drop of blood in his cage, though."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, that’s strange,” said the doctor. “Anything else? Any sign that his cage was opened?"
  </p>
  <p>
  I hadn’t seen him like this before. Agitated, animated. Typically the doctor was more thoughtful, every motion considered. He stopped pacing and looked at me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Nothing that I could see,” I said. “I haven’t touched the cage. Does anyone else have a keycard?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, Sarah. Just us."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, what about the backup? We should be able to see where the video stopped recording, at least. Might give us some idea of what happened."
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor was fanatical about backups. All our files were automatically backed up every hour to a large server tower in a corner of the lab. He shook his head.
  </p>
  <p>
  “The data is sent automatically every 24 hours. I checked before I came into the lab. Nothing was sent from yesterday. I was hoping it was just some delay here.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I tried another tactic.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Let’s try to get some work done. I don’t know what could have happened to B6-R5, but his cage is still closed. I don’t see how he could have escaped."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, ok,” he said. “I just, you know. Don’t want any more upsets here. Not with the talk coming up."
  </p>
  <p>
  Dr. Stack was leaving early that afternoon for his conference. He spent the next few hours on the phone, pacing up and down the hallway outside the lab. The steady rhythm of his voice through the lab door made me drowsy. I drank more coffee, and tried to focus on my work. I tried not to think about the missing rabbit.
  </p>
  <p>
  I scrubbed the water bottle clean before I left for the day.
  </p>
  <p>
  Big Ra watched as I locked up, sitting upright on fresh bedding in his cage.
  </p>
  <p>
  The stray drop of blood on that water bottle stuck in my mind on my long walk home.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  B6-R7 was missing the next morning. His neighbor B6-R6 was in her cage, safe and sound to the left of his empty cage. She stood and sniffed the air when I walked past. There was no sign of escape in the empty cage. Just another cage with no rabbit.
  </p>
  <p>
  I looked down the row of cages at Big Ra. B6-R4, the survivor. He stared back, twitched an ear, and something squirmed behind his right eye.
  </p>
  <p>
  I pulled up a folding chair and sat in front of Big Ra’s cage. The rabbit blinked, slowly, and there was another flicker of pale movement behind his eye. Something like a worm. A lump rose in my throat. All signs of infection had disappeared during his week in quarantine. I took more samples after we put him back into general population. No trouble. Just regular, boring rabbit blood.
  </p>
  <p>
  I picked up a biopsy needle from the dissection table. My steps echoed in the lab as I walked back to the cage and opened the door.
  </p>
  <p>
  I reached in with a shaking hand, but the rabbit didn’t try to escape. He crouched in the center of the cage as I held him behind the head and withdrew a tissue sample. I closed the door to his cage, and double checked to make sure it latched.
  </p>
  <p>
  My hands shook as I spread the tissue sample between two glass plates, then slid it into place in the microscope. I should have followed procedure. I should have properly fixed the specimen before observation, but I felt a nagging sense of urgency.
  </p>
  <p>
  I hoped to find normal, healthy tissue. Cells with organized structure, or signs of an infection. I didn’t understand what I saw trapped between the glass slides. I could understand an infection. But the sample was wrong in a way that can’t be bound by words. I don’t have the vocabulary to express what happened when I lowered my eyes to the microscope.
  </p>
  <p>
  A strange, writhing mass boiled between the glass slides, completely lacking any familiar organization or structure. My eyes focused and unfocused rapidly as a sharp, insistent headache blossomed in the center of my forehead. I smelled a familiar odor. Something like ozone and spilled ammonia.
  </p>
  <p>
  Something dripped onto the front of my lab coat. I tore my eyes away from the microscope. The flesh around my eyes was tender, and I realized I had been forcing my face forward. As if I was trying to get closer to the sample. A large drop of blood was spreading into the fibers of my white lab coat. I raised a hand to my nose, and my fingers came away bloody.
  </p>
  <p>
  I staggered into the hall, my head tilted back, holding my nose shut. I fumbled at the paper towel dispenser in the restroom. My face was pale in the mirror, and blood soaked through the fistful of paper towels pressed to my nose. Both eyes were bloodshot. There was no white visible in my left eye. Just bright, vibrant red. My mouth tasted like vomit. Like sour spit.
  </p>
  <p>
  A noise tore through my mind as I stared at myself in the mirror. Something half wild thought and half screeching, discordant music. A wave of nausea forced to the wet floor, my head resting against the trashcan. The bloody wad of paper towels tumbled from my hand.
  </p>
  <p>
  I don’t know how long I sat on the restroom floor, bloody and sick. Once I felt steady enough to stand, I went back into the lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  B6-R4 sat upright in his cage, and his head swiveled to follow me as I crossed the lab. The thing in the cage watched me with great interest. I put on a pair of surgical gloves, picked up a needle from the dissection tray, and filled it with a double dose of pentobarbital. More than enough to kill a rabbit. Just in case.
  </p>
  <p>
  The door to B6-R4’s cage opened smoothly. I grasped the thing firmly behind its head. The flesh of its neck felt strange in my gloved hand, and I didn’t bother stroking his fur, or cooing to him. I injected the pentobarbital and held the thing firmly as it blinked its eyes, then closed them forever.
  </p>
  <p>
  I waited a few more seconds, then lifted the small corpse out of the cage. The lab was strangely quiet as I walked from the row of cages to the small examination area. The other rabbits didn’t dig in their bedding, or drink from their water bottles. I turned on my small digital recorder.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Surgical examination of subject B6-R4,” I said. I always felt dumb when I recorded myself.
  </p>
  <p>
  I put on a surgical mask and picked up a scalpel. The initial incision parted the white fur on Big Ra’s stomach, releasing a foul stench from the guts of the thing. The mask didn’t prevent me from gagging. I don’t know what I expected to find when I cut B6-R4 open, but it certainly wasn’t the army of tiny, writhing creatures that poured out onto the stainless steel dissection table. Or the tentacle-like appendage that forced itself out of the hollow in the thing's abdomen, groping blindly. A dark mouth lined with needles opened on the end of the tentacle.
  </p>
  <p>
  Somehow I controlled my gag reflex. I was a scientist, and I meant to do some science. My headache subsided as I got to work, noting observations, speaking about what I was doing, and what was happening on the examination table.
  </p>
  <p>
  The slugs seemed to be dying outside of B6-R4’s warm, protective body. The things couldn’t climb the rim of the metal tray. I was glad. This was a mess, and I wanted to keep it contained. The mouth on the tentacle opened and closed a few more times before it stopped searching and coiled around the corpse of the thing.
  </p>
  <p>
  I worked in near silence for several minutes, recording stray observations as I explored.
  </p>
  <p>
  The abdominal cavity was unrecognizable. B6-R4’s internal organs had been replaced with cancerous looking black sacs. A poke at one ruptured the sac, spilling foul smelling yellow liquid and more dying slugs onto the table.
  </p>
  <p>
  Something scraped against the concrete behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
  A rabbit sat on the floor in front of the cages. B6-R6’s cage was empty and the door was closed. Subjects B6-R8 and B6-R9 pressed their bodies against the doors of their cages. Pink noses strained against the wire bars.
  </p>
  <p>
  The missing rabbits were both male. The remaining rabbits were all female. Big Ra had been busy since I put him back into general population.
  </p>
  <p>
  The rabbit’s body twisted mid stride as it came toward me. B6-R6’s white fur ran like liquid wax, elongating into spiny protrusions. Its limbs stretched and thickened as its jaw unhinged. Three tentacles covered in thorny protrusions erupted from its mouth, flailing at the air and scraping against the floor. The rabbit’s underbelly tore itself apart, and teeth sprouted from the sides of the tear. The thing stank of ammonia as it moved across the lab with the alien grace of a spider. A line from Jabberwocky scuttled across my mind as the thing burbled toward me. My throat convulsed, and I felt wetness on my chin. My tongue crept out, and I tasted blood on my lips.
  </p>
  <p>
  I stumbled away from the awful thing, running hip first into the wall behind me. My mother’s spade clattered to the ground. I picked it up in a clumsy two handed grip as the thing lashed forward with its tentacles. It seized my ankle and pulled, tripping me. I came down hard on my elbow and the spade spun away as the creature advanced again.
  </p>
  <p>
  I crawled backward, searching blindly for the spade. Blood poured freely from my nose as my vision blurred. My eyes ached as they constantly focused and unfocused on the thing slithering toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing whined, a continuous high pitched sound. Like the noise the machine made. I jerked my head, trying not to look at it, and my hand brushed against the handle of the spade. I swung the tool just as the thing leapt toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
  The creature exploded when I connected with the business end of the spade. The whine cut out immediately as it sailed backward, landing a few feet behind the exit loop with a wet noise. Its crawling flesh wasted no time forming new exploratory appendages, digging into minute cracks in the concrete. What was left of the rabbit’s head swung toward me, blinking multiple sets of eyes. It fixed me with its gaze, each eye slightly out of sync with its partner, dragging itself across the concrete floor of the lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  Stray chunks of matter moved toward the central mass, rolling along the floor, and merging with other pieces of flesh. The thing buckled and shivered, growing in size as its wayward bits came home.
  </p>
  <p>
  The wire doors of the rabbit cages banged, and a quivering liquid mass poured through the bars of B6-R8’s cage. It crawled along the floor, joining with the spidery monster on the floor. The thing grew larger still. Larger than it should have been, given how much mass it had to work with. The creature was now the size of a large dog, creeping toward me, and building new appendages as it came.
  </p>
  <p>
  A second head sprouted to the left of the thing’s open mouth, lined with teeth, and gnashing at the air. I didn’t wait for the thing to come after me. I got to my feet, hefted the spade, and severed its writhing tentacles against the floor of the lab. The thing reeled and lashed out again with its tentacles, but it wasn't close enough to trip me.
  </p>
  <p>
  I brought the spade down again, on the thing’s neck. Its misshapen body spasmed, and the second head caught part of my pant leg between its snapping jaws. I kicked until the thing let go. The lab began to go dark. I shook my head to clear it, and brought the spade down on the second head. Then again, and again. I didn’t stop until the ground was scored with gouges full of strange blood. The creature stopped moving eventually, but I didn’t know whether it was dead or dazed.
  </p>
  <p>
  I leaned against the spade. A ringing in my ears built to a spectacular headache, and the back of my throat was raw.
  </p>
  <p>
  The remaining rabbit strained against the bars of its cage. B6-R9’s tongue had split and hardened into pincers, and it worked against the metal bars. Eager to join its comrades.
  </p>
  <p>
  I leaned the spade against the wall and sat at my desk until my head cleared. The air in the lab was thick, and my chest and neck were on fire. I sat for a long time, keeping my eyes on B6-R9.
  </p>
  <p>
  I should have called the CDC right then, but my only thoughts were on survival. A plan formed as I sat in the lab, trying to catch my breath, and trying not to look at the impossible thing strewn across the floor. I fumbled for the key card in the deep pocket of my lab coat. I crossed the lab, and pulled the door shut behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
  There was a janitorial closet down the hall, across from the incinerator. I stumbled down the hallway, covered in blood and gore. I hoped the door wasn’t locked. I hoped I wouldn’t be seen.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was in luck, and found the door unlocked. I heard a noise behind me, a familiar, unfurling noise, and looked over my shoulder to make sure I was alone. The hallway was empty. I shook my head again, trying to focus on the task at hand. My brain felt loose in my skull.
  </p>
  <p>
  There was an old heater in one corner of the closet with a large red container of kerosene on top. On the floor, I found a cardboard box with a lid, a bottle of spray cleaner, and a roll of paper towels. I stashed the supplies in the box and headed back to the lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  I had to steady the keycard with my other hand to slide it into the card reader. The final rabbit was still working at the bars.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’ll be with you in a minute,” I croaked. The rabbit whined in response, a high-pitched, shuddery hum like the one made by the one on the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
  The remains of B6-R6 moved feebly as I approached. I poked it with the spade, but it didn’t try to fight. It seemed to have shrunk while I was out of the lab. The floor was streaked with something that looked like mucus, and blood.
  </p>
  <p>
  I scraped the remains into the lid, dumping them inside the box. Ropes of bloody material clung to the lid as the thing’s translucent skin squirmed in the bottom of the box. Its skin split, and three mutated things unrecognizable as rabbits crawled out. They explored the bottom of the cardboard box with spine-covered flesh and wet, pulsing growths. The babies were too small and weak to climb the cardboard walls, but I kept an eye on them.
  </p>
  <p>
  I sprayed the bloody floor with the cleaner, then bent and scoured the grooves and chips I’d made in the concrete. I covered the horrible things inside the box with handfuls of paper towels smeared with blood, viscera and cleaning fluid. Finally satisfied with my work, I put the lid back on the box.
  </p>
  <p>
  The box went into the incinerator downstairs, and I watched it burn through the tiny grime-covered window in the door. I held a handkerchief over my mouth and nose to block the awful smell. Then I went back to the lab for the survivor, walking through empty hallways on unsteady feet.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I knew I should have contacted the CDC. Or the head of the chemistry wing. Or anyone at all. But after what happened in the lab, I couldn’t bear the thought of talking to another human being. I just wanted to get home and sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
  My mind crawled on the long walk home to my studio apartment. Autumn leaves underfoot twisted themselves into strange geometrical shapes. The entire world was too bright, too loud, and I just wanted to get home and shut everything out. Twice I heard a heavy, tearing sound behind me. The same sound I heard in the hallway to the incinerator. There was nothing behind me either time.
  </p>
  <p>
  I locked the deadbolt behind me, then slid down my front door and sat on my kitchen floor. I was exhausted. Like I’d been sick for a long time, and my body was still recovering. Finally, I got up, peeled off my clothes, and took a scalding hot shower.
  </p>
  <p>
  I lay awake for hours that night, every light burning. My skin felt wrong, the thin sheets of my bed too heavy. I could almost feel B6-R6’s blind children crawling and searching over my body. My left hand moved on its own, rubbing at my right forearm. Digging and picking.
  </p>
  <p>
  Eventually I sat up in bed, smoking cigarette after cigarette. The air in my apartment stank of cheap smoke and burnt matches.
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor called at 3:12 am. He didn’t leave a voicemail.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I felt better the next morning. Good enough to go into the lab to tell Dr. Stack I was quitting, and notifying the CDC of what happened the day before. I’d just inserted my keycard when he flung the door open, his thin frame barring my entrance into the lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sarah, where are the rabbits? What happened to B6-R4?"
  </p>
  <p>
  His hair stood up in greasy spikes, and there was a smooth, curved metal arc peeking over his shoulder. Something new. Curiosity got the better of me, and I forgot about quitting for a moment. I stood on my tiptoes to get a better look. It was a new, larger set of loops. The prototype loops were pushed against the far wall of the lab, forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Something went wrong,” I said. “Let me in, and I’ll tell you about it."
  </p>
  <p>
  He ran a hand through his hair, and moved out of my way. I told him everything, leaving out the part where I collapsed on the restroom floor with blood, piss, and water soaking through my pants.
  </p>
  <p>
  He scribbled in his notebook as I spoke, and stopped me often to ask questions. We spoke for nearly an hour. Dr. Stack's eyes widened when I told him about B6-R4’s blood and the encounter with B6-R6. The reactions from B6-R8 and B6-R9. My theory about what B6-R4 was up to at night. The pen in his hand jittered and danced.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We have to stop, Richard.”
  </p>
  <p>
  His pen grew still between his fingers, and the doctor cocked his head to the side. I never used his first name. Dr. Stack, sure. Bones, Watson, sure. But Richard got his attention. Dr. Stack narrowed his eyes, and shook his head.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We can’t stop now, Sarah. This is what I’ve been working for. We’re finally making progress."
  </p>
  <p>
  He believed what he was saying. He wasn’t horrified, or repulsed. Dr. Stack's face was earnest, and his eyes were clear. I looked over my shoulder at the larger set of loops.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I don’t think you understand,” I said. “I’m going to quit, and I’m going to tell someone. The CDC, for starters. This could be contagious."
  </p>
  <p>
  His mouth fell open. Dr. Stack started to say something, shook his head again, and then found his voice.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What do you mean, quit?” he said. “Sarah, you can’t quit now. We’re this close!"
  </p>
  <p>
  He held his finger and thumb out about an inch apart. Dr. Stack considered the distance, then closed them just a tiny bit more.
  </p>
  <p>
  “And the CDC? We’ve taken the precautions. We had B6-R4 in quarantine for a week. Why, if it was contagious, don’t you think we’d be presenting already?"
  </p>
  <p>
  He had a point, but I didn’t mention my reaction on the way home yesterday. The world had returned to normal this morning, more or less, though I wore a heavy pair of sunglasses on my way into the lab. I hadn’t heard any strange noises on my way into the lab, and my nose wasn’t bleeding.
  </p>
  <p>
  “And the CDC! What do you think the government’s going to do with our work, once they get their hands on it?"
  </p>
  <p>
  He stood and began pacing. Dr. Stack’s lip curled when he mentioned the government.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m really not up for a lesson on libertarianism right now,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  Dr. Stack looked at his clenched fist, raised in the air before him, and put it back in the pocket of his lab coat.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Where were you yesterday?” I asked. “I thought you had a conference."
  </p>
  <p>
  He stopped pacing in front of the new machines.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, I had a meeting with my colleague and the fabricators. We brought in the new equipment last night, and they helped install it."
  </p>
  <p>
  “You can’t mean to continue. Not with the rabbits. Not after what’s happened."
  </p>
  <p>
  He sat down in his chair again, and leaned forward. Close enough I could smell he hadn’t showered recently. The skin under his eyes looked bruised and paper thin.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, let’s take a break from the rabbits. I think we’re done with live trials for now. Let’s go over the data again. See if we can figure out what happened. Once we’ve gone through the data, I’ll happily accept your resignation, if that’s what you still want. How does that sound?”
  </p>
  <p>
  I nodded. My stomach churned, but I was still a scientist.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I took notes while dissecting B6-R4. I don’t have any on the others, because they were simply euthanized and incinerated. But the dissection notes may be helpful. I’ll type them up."
  </p>
  <p>
  He nodded, smiling faintly at the word “euthanized”. Dr. Stack looked at the gore-spattered spade, and the grooves in the concrete floor.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We’ve got some more clean up to do,” he said. “Let’s get started.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The practical work of science took my mind off the events of the previous day. We worked late into the afternoon. Doctor Stack asked multiple questions, and hummed as he typed up his notes from our conversation.
  </p>
  <p>
  He was still at the lab when I left, hunched forward in his desk chair reading the notes from B6-R4’s dissection. He spent a lot of time examining the photos of the thing’s twisted corpse.
  </p>
  <p>
  Dr. Stack didn’t look up from my notes when I left. No half-hearted compliments. No shaky little thumbs up.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I found the lab door half open the next morning, and put my keycard back in the pocket of my lab coat. A bright streak of blood stretched across the floor of the lab from the exit loop to the quarantine room. A lab coat was crumpled against the door.
  </p>
  <p>
  I put my bag down by the door and walked around the entrance loop. The blood on the concrete was alive with chunks of squirming flesh. I took a wide step over the trail of blood, careful not to get any on my sensible flats.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Doctor?” I called, already knowing what I'd find.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing in the lab coat barely resembled the man I’d worked with for half a year. It hooked a clawed hand around the base of the entrance loop and dragged itself forward. Its head swiveled up, staring at me with a new set of eyes sprouted along its left cheek.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Su-Sarahh,” it croaked. “I went…through, Sarah. I was Outside."
  </p>
  <p>
  The doctor's voice dripped with reverence. The kind of voice you would use inside a church. The skin of his face slid around on his skull with every movement, and the lower half of his body appeared to have disintegrated. His pants lay forgotten on the floor next to the exit loop.
  </p>
  <p>
  There were more strange, busy chunks in the fresh gore on the concrete floor, closest to the doctor’s body. Something like a centipede writhed in a large clot of blood and struggled toward the drain in the center of the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
  I backed away from what was left of Dr. Stack and stepped on the centipede on my way to the far side of the lab. It popped under my shoe with a wet noise of protest. So much for my sensible flats. I picked up the spade, finding the heavy tool comfortable in my hands.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You knew about the rabbits."
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing on the floor started laughing. I thought it was laughter, anyway. It was rhythmic noise of some kind, but there was no mirth or joy in the sound.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It was…calling me, Sarah. I had to go. Couldn’t…let you stop me."
  </p>
  <p>
  What was left of Dr. Stack stank of ammonia, and my stomach turned over again. Like the day with the rabbits. Hello, nausea, my old friend.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What was calling you?” I asked. I didn’t want to know, but the question was out before I could stop myself.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It was glorious. It opened its Eye, and…saw me, Sarah. Something Outside."
  </p>
  <p>
  He crawled closer as he spoke. I stepped backward and stumbled against the heavy metal frame of the loop. His left arm shot out, impossibly long, a misshapen hand wrapping around my right ankle. The fingers elongated with a crunch, its grip like iron. The thing gurgled and spat, and I fought back a wave of nausea as I brought the spade down on its arm.
  </p>
  <p>
  The arm separated easily, just below the elbow. The hand's grip loosened, but it didn’t let go. The hand crawled up my leg like a misshapen insect, each nail digging into my pants. The thing on the floor started laughing again.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It saw me. It saw meeeee,” it sang, and dragged itself closer. Its jaw split and extended to either side, constructing a hasty mandible that clicked furiously as the thing crawled after me. I planted my feet, gripped the spade with both hands, and brought it down on the thing’s neck. There was no scrape against bone, no protest of sinew. Just a quick, messy separation. The force of the blow sent the thing’s head rolling backward toward the quarantine room, its mandible scrabbling against the floor of the lab, multiple sets of eyes rolling madly.
  </p>
  <p>
  The hand tightened below my knee, eating through the thin fabric of my pants and burning my skin. In disgust, I kicked my leg until the hand flew off and hit the glass wall of the quarantine room with a splat. My right pant leg hung in tatters, and the skin beneath was a bright, angry red.
  </p>
  <p>
  I smashed the hand with the spade until its fingers curled inward like the legs of a dead insect. Something moved beneath the lab coat. A busy, buckling motion.
  </p>
  <p>
  Rabbits were one thing, but the doctor wouldn’t fit in the incinerator. Even if half his body was smeared across the floor of the lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  I licked my chapped lips, tasting blood, snot, and something foreign. My chest heaved and my arms ached as I leaned against the spade. I wanted to run, but I had work to do. There was time to collapse later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The flesh underneath the lab coat still crawled and searched, but it was too feeble to come after me. It seemed to be dying, and I felt as safe as I could sharing a room with something that tried to kill me. Something that had taken over a friend. I smelled copper, and tipped my head back. Even thinking about the thing brought on a nosebleed, though it wasn’t as bad as the day with the rabbits.
  </p>
  <p>
  I leaned the spade against the glass wall of the quarantine room and stepped into the hall. I bent over, hands on my knees, sucking in deep, greedy breaths until my nausea subsided. The air in the hall outside the lab was different. Less dense. As if the thing that came through the loop had filled the atmosphere inside the lab. Images of a mushroom releasing clouds of spores and a slide full of bacteria flickered across my mind.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thoughts weren't helpful, and I pushed them away. I dug in the pocket of my lab coat, searching for my keycard. I pulled the door shut behind me and headed down the hall to the janitorial closet.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Hello, beautiful,” I whispered to the container of kerosene. I hauled it off the top of the old heater. The container was heavier than I anticipated, and I almost dropped it. Good. I needed a lot of kerosene. I lugged it back to the lab with both hands.
  </p>
  <p>
  I expected an ambush when I unlocked the door to the lab. A desperate final stand. But the lab was quiet. The thing laid in front of the quarantine area, surrounded by a thickening pool of blood. I set the kerosene down, opened the door to quarantine, and scraped the remains of Dr. Stack inside with my mother’s spade.
  </p>
  <p>
  Its head had sprouted tentacles from the stump of its neck. The head clung to the concrete floor and grasped feebly at the spade with its tongue. One black and accusing eye glared at me when I pushed it into the quarantine room next to its body. A streak of thick blood stretched from the body to its head, as if in welcoming.
  </p>
  <p>
  I soaked the lab coat with kerosene, paying special attention to the head and severed hand. I took the match book out of my pocket, steadying my shaking hand until I got a match to light. I dropped the tiny flame on the lab coat, and it erupted with eager, friendly flames. I shut the door as the quarantine room filled with black, foul smelling smoke.
  </p>
  <p>
  The lab didn’t have a sprinkler system, but we did have a very nice ventilation system. The smoke was sucked out of the quarantine room as the flames grew, greedy for fuel. The thing was silent as it burned, but the movement below the coat grew frantic. Misshapen limbs burst through the back of the coat, scratching madly at the glass walls, desperate for escape. The head scurried along the floor, searching for an exit.
  </p>
  <p>
  But the fire won. The thing in the coat stopped moving long before the fire ran out of fuel. The head settled just inside the door, a single black eye fixated on me.
  </p>
  <p>
  I scanned the lab for any sign of movement. Any hint that something from the doctor’s corpse had escaped. Nothing. All clear.
  </p>
  <p>
  I gathered all the doctor's notes. His laptop and his personal leather bound journal. The back up server. I put everything I wanted to save in a chair in the hallway, and unplugged the rest of the equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
  I went to work on the machinery with the spade. The fabricators did good work, and the machines were resilient, but I was persistent. Soon the things lay in pieces so numerous I was confident no one could reassemble them. Then I smashed the computers, the control station, the camera, and every piece of equipment we’d used for the last six months.
  </p>
  <p>
  I worried the noise would draw attention, but the hall outside the lab was blissfully empty. It was a weekend, and still early. Too early in this part of the school for all but the most dedicated of scientists.
  </p>
  <p>
  I covered everything in the lab with kerosene. The floor was concrete, but our desks and other furniture would burn.
  </p>
  <p>
  I hoped the fire wouldn’t get too greedy and starve itself once I locked the door. I hoped it would be enough to destroy the equipment, and prevent anyone else from going through. I figured the air conditioning would provide enough oxygen, and I knew I had some time before anyone would notice the fire.
  </p>
  <p>
  I wasn’t trained as an arsonist, but I did a good job. I didn’t want to leave behind any trace of our work. Before I shut the door to the lab, I left the container of kerosene in front of Big Ra’s old cage.
  </p>
  <p>
  The fire was spectacular. I watched the flames spread through the reinforced glass window of the lab door. The fire gobbled up the kerosene on the concrete floor and devoured the lab equipment. Once I was sure the fire was going to stick around, I double checked the door, then picked up the server. I shoved the doctor's notebook and laptop into my shoulder bag, and walked down the hallway outside the lab one last time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Saving his notes felt like a fitting memorial. It wasn’t right to let our work go entirely to waste.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I meant to call someone. I did. I really did. On the long walk home, lugging the heavy tower, I planned to call the authorities once I got home. The police. The CDC. Anyone I could think of.
  </p>
  <p>
  My leg was on fire when I finally got home. I pushed the heavy server tower deep in my bedroom closet and hid it underneath some old clothes. I put the bag with Dr. Stack’s notes down on my bed.
  </p>
  <p>
  The light in the bathroom was too bright when I took my pants off to survey the damage. A dark, cheerful bruise greeted me, running from my right ankle to my knee. The flesh was tender where the thing had grabbed me, and my skin was burnt.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Shit,” I said. I dug through my medicine cabinet for iodine and a bandage. I raised my leg onto the sink, cleaned the wound as best I could, then wrapped it. My leg felt like a sausage, but the throbbing began to fade.
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn’t bother putting my pants back on. I made a pot of coffee, and sat at my desk to read the doctor’s notes.
  </p>
  <p>
  I expected to be interrupted by call from the school, or the police, or the fire department. Or the doctor’s colleague, eager for revenge. The fabricators, furious at what I had done to their work. I glanced nervously at my cell phone, lying upside down on my desk.
  </p>
  <p>
  Soon all thoughts of contacting anyone were pushed from my mind. I read for hours with no interruptions. The notebook was thick and its pages were filled with the doctor’s cramped handwriting.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tone of the journal changed just before our successful trial with B6-R4. Dr. Stack’s later entries read more like a personal diary than detailed logs of a scientific experiment. He had the same dream, night after night. There was something in the dark. Something Outside. Something watching him with the fondness of a parent. Giving him ideas. Encouraging him, pushing him forward. He went on like this for pages at a time. Purple prose followed by short, cold notations of experiments in the lab hours later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The last entry was dated early that morning. About an hour before I found him on the floor, covered in blood, giggling, and out of his mind.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’m coming.
  </p>
  <p>
  I swallowed, and the motion in my throat was foreign. Like I had to remember how to use the muscles. I closed the leather note book, and stretched in my chair. The muscles in my back were cramped and aching.
  </p>
  <p>
  My leg burned and itched, tight in its wrapping. Something squirmed in my blood, just below my burnt skin. An honored guest.
