  <h1><small id="small-header">Transmission</small></h1>
  <p>
  My car broke down about 45 minutes west of Ely, Nevada. I’d stopped to fill up my gas tank, grabbed a burger, and politely declined an invitation to visit the local railway museum. I’d hardly started to digest the burger before I heard a CLUNK under the hood and my car started weaving drunkenly back and forth across highway 50.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was supposed to loop up north to Portland for a 4th of July party at my friend Steve’s, get shitfaced, then stop at Vegas to lose what was left of my savings before returning to Michigan for school. Forget those plans. The front end of the car shuddered, and it was all I could do to make a safe landing on the side of the road.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh, you fuck!” I said, and punched the steering wheel until the skin on my middle knuckle split open.
  </p>
  <p>
  My car breaking down in the middle of the fucking desert was definitely not on my itinerary. I turned off the engine and glared at the hood of the car through the dusty windshield. An adventurous wisp of smoke wafted through a gap where the hood didn't quite line up with the body of the car.
  </p>
  <p>
  The hood popped open with a groan when I yanked on the release. More smoke billowed out, and the stench of burnt oil came searching for me through the open window. Terrific. I slammed the door shut behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’m not a car guy, but the old girl was dead. I’d been driving her since my senior year of high school, and she’d given up at last. I fumbled with the hood support and finally locked it into place. Once the smoke cleared, the engine looked fine. To my untrained eye, anyway. I didn’t even know what a problem would look like. I gagged on the smell of hot metal and burnt oil and pulled out my phone.
  </p>
  <p>
  Nothing. No bars. Not even roaming. My phone wasn’t even pretending to be useful.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Great, just fucking great,” I said. "What am I going to do now, you dead piece of shit?”
  </p>
  <p>
  The car didn't reply. I tried the key in the ignition. Not even a whisper from the engine.
  </p>
  <p>
  I pulled a battered road map out of the glove box to get an idea of where I was. The map was slightly more useful than my phone. For sure, I was somewhere west of Ely, on highway 50.
  </p>
  <p>
  I traced a route to Eureka, the next closest town. It didn’t look far on the map, but it was probably thirty or forty miles away.
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn't like what I was about to do. I fucking hated it, not to put too fine a point on it. I popped the trunk and left the driver side door hanging open in the desert air. I could see for miles in all directions. Nothing but empty road and desert.
  </p>
  <p>
  The trunk held two duffel bags, some snacks and a case of water. One of the bags was full of clothes. The other was full of supplies for my trip. Extra cash, deodorant, sunblock, and my dad's Colt .45. I kept the pistol in the bottom of the bag, wrapped in a towel, underneath notebooks and my camera. My mom didn't know I brought it with me. She gave me the map. Dad gave me his gun.
  </p>
  <p>
  I unzipped a navy blue duffel bag with Montauk Christian Academy written across the side in white lettering. My mom picked it up somewhere years ago. Probably in Montauk. The gun lay nestled in a dark wooden case with brass clasps.
  </p>
  <p>
  The pistol was always heavier than I thought it would be. I slammed a clip into place with the butt of my palm, then double checked the safety. I tucked the gun into the waistband of my underwear, the way guys do in movies. It felt stable enough, but I worried about shooting myself in the ass. I checked the safety again, and put it back. It rested against the skin on my lower back, a strangely comforting weight.
  </p>
  <p>
  I dumped the rest of the bag into the trunk. Pens, notebooks, a flask, my camera, extra batteries, and a flashlight. I put the flashlight and batteries back in the bag, then added 12 bottles of water. The bag wasn’t too heavy. I bent and flexed my knees. The bag bounced uncomfortably against my hip. II pulled out an old beach towel with a giant stylized pink flamingo and gave it a few shakes, sending dirt and dust flying.
  </p>
  <p>
  I folded the towel and stuffed it into the side of the duffel to cushion it, then added another 12 bottles of water. I grabbed a box of granola bars and a bag of beef jerky, then drank a bottle of water and tossed it into the trunk.
  </p>
  <p>
  I slammed the trunk, rolled up my window, then hit the lock button. Better safe than sorry. I took one last look around. Still nothing. Miles of nothing. I tapped the car on the hood, and headed west on foot.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’d been driving that old car since I was seventeen, and I didn’t know it then, but I’d never see it again.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  Fours hours later I found a dusty gas station nestled in a little valley. A couple of beat up trucks in the small parking lot told me it wasn’t deserted. The place was the Promised Land as far as I was concerned. My walking tour of the desert was phenomenally hot and boring. It was almost 1 o'clock, and I’d already drunk four bottles of water. I drank another in celebration, then headed down the hill.
  </p>
  <p>
  A large yellow sign was stapled to the wall above a porch running the length of the front of the store.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Bob's,” I read. “Gas, fireworks.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I tossed the empty water bottles into a trash can next to a sagging wooden bench, and a jangle of tin bells above the rickety screen door announced my presence.
  </p>
  <p>
  The interior was poorly lit and the merchandise looked like it had been there a while. Two men were talking inside Bob's, one seated behind the counter and another standing in front of him. The second guy crossed his arms when I entered and chomped on a wad of tobacco.
  </p>
  <p>
  I set the heavy bag down next to a circular postcard rack and rubbed my shoulder where the strap had bitten into my skin. The bag didn't seem heavy when I left my car, but I’d had enough of carrying it after four hours in the desert.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Howdy,” said the man behind the counter. He was heavy with sad hound dog eyes, a red alcoholic's nose, and dark, thinning hair. I decided he was Bob. His friend didn't say anything. He wore a heavy mustache and a scowl on his face.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Afternoon,” I said. The three of us stood in silence and stared at each other for a second or three.
  </p>
  <p>
  “My uh, car broke down. About ten miles east of here. Any chance I could use your phone, try and get a tow?”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ain't you got no cell phone?” Bob's friend asked. He spat brown liquid into an empty soda bottle. He took a gummy worm out of a dusty fishbowl on the counter, and put the thing in his mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Shut up, Ernie,” said Bob. "Sure you can, no problem. Might call my friend Ted, he's got a tow truck. He ought to be home about now. Might be sober, too, if you're lucky.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Bob laughed at his joke.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Thanks, I appreciate it,” I said. "I'm David, by the way.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Bob grasped my hand, gave it a single pump and let go.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Nice to meet you. I'm Bob. You probably saw the sign outside. This is Ernie.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Ernie shot a quick glance at the door, like he was expecting someone. I left my hand hanging in the air between us until Ernie shook it.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Where you headed, kid?” asked Ernie. He eyed me as Bob pulled a black rotary dial phone out from under the counter.
  </p>
  <p>
  The bells above the doorway jangled again.
  </p>
  <p>
  My balls tried to crawl up inside my body when I saw what stood in the doorway beneath those tin bells. Outlined by the bright Nevada sun was something that looked like a woman, but it was wrong in a basic, fundamental way. I felt like I’d seen a spider scurry across the floor, uninvited and unwelcome.
  </p>
  <p>
  It had lank, dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, and waves of heat radiated from it as it stood unsteadily in the doorway. Like asphalt baking in the summer.
  </p>
  <p>
  The three of us gaped at the intruder. Bob held the phone in the air, the index finger of his left hand stuck in the slot for the number 2.
  </p>
  <p>
  It took two wobbling steps toward us, as if it were drunk or unused to using its legs. Its gaze jumped from Ernie, to me, to Bob and back to me.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing opened its mouth and spoke, a single command croaked out between gray teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Give me your gun, David.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Its voice had the quality of a bad recording, like something heard from a great distance. Its face twisted with the effort of speaking. Something happened inside my head when it spoke. Something like a fist reaching in, and pulling.
  </p>
  <p>
  My right arm moved on its own and pulled the .45 from the small of my back, then handed it to the thing butt first.
  </p>
  <p>
  My body seemed to be frozen as the thing thumbed back the safety, raised the gun, and shot Ernie in the face. Ernie’s mouth hung open mid chomp on his wad of tobacco before his head jerked with the impact and coated the drop ceiling with blood. His arm pinwheeled, knocking the fishbowl to the floor. The sound of shattering glass came to me from a great distance. The thing's arm moved smoothly toward Bob. The gun roared again, and Bob's chin exploded in a spray of blood, gristle, and bone. His body collapsed back into his folding chair before he slumped forward. Bob’s forehead hit the counter with a sharp sound.
  </p>
  <p>
  The phone clattered to the floor and beeped in irritation.
  </p>
  <p>
  My body was a stranger, and growing pressure in my ears gave me the sense of being underwater. Slowly, the thing lowered the gun and turned to me. I tried to pull my eyes away, but tendons creaked in my neck and my head swiveled to meet it. Its eyes were flat and black, like a shark’s eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Thank you, David,” it said. It smiled, lips splitting in a grin that never touched those empty eyes, showing off a mouth full of grubby little gray teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
  There was no safe place to rest my eyes in the store. Bob’s brains dripped down the wall of cigarette cartons behind the counter. Ernie’s left leg kicked a few times, then lay still. The spreading pool of his blood crept down the crooked floor toward me, nearly reaching Ernie’s shit kicking boots.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Are you going to kill me, too?” My voice was smaller than a child's.
  </p>
  <p>
  An eternity passed before the thing disguised replies.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No,” it said. “I'm not going to...kill...you.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Its voice was rough and wet, and each word seemed to take a tremendous effort. It took an apple juice from a refrigerated display, clamped its teeth around the cap, and tore it off with a jerk. It drained the bottle in several long swallows, then grabbed another.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Better,” it said, and grinned at me. An old predator’s grin. The stink of ozone wafted out of its mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Grab your...bag,” it said. The tendons in its hand bulged and flexed on the grip of my father’s pistol. I didn’t waste any time obeying. I slung my bag back over my shoulder.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Outside,” it croaked, jerking its head and the gun toward the door. A sick feeling grew in the pit of my stomach.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Listen,” I said. “I don't-”
  </p>
  <p>
  Its left hand shot out, sure as a viper, and clamped around my right wrist.
  </p>
  <p>
  Its touch was horrible beyond telling. That sick feeling in my stomach spread into my arm, and my bones felt sick when its bloated fingers circled my wrist. I didn't recognize the high pitched whine coming out of my mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok, ok, ok!” I said. "Christ, just let go.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing let go of my wrist, but the sick feeling in my bones grew worse. I stumbled backward into a revolving rack of postcards near the door, and the full body nausea subsided the tiniest bit.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing wore only one shoe, and the puddle of Ernie’s blood had surrounded its bare foot. The thing watched me with keen interest, and I found myself fascinated by those flat, black eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  With a shaky hand, I pulled open the door and stepped into heavy Nevada sunshine. I’d been inside Bob's Gas and Fireworks for 15 minutes at most, but it felt like hours.
  </p>
  <p>
  I collapsed on the bench next to the door, fighting an easing tide of nausea, and opened a bottle of water. I rinsed and spat, then drank the rest. The pressure in my head ebbed and flowed. My vision swam as I sat on that rough wooden bench, the rush of blood loud and eager in my ears.
  </p>
  <p>
  The door yawned open and the thing stepped outside to join me. It walked a few feet to the right and sagged against a rough wooden beam. It left a single bloody footprint on the poured concrete porch surrounding the store. The pistol dangled carelessly at its side.
  </p>
  <p>
  I wanted to look at it. In spite of the things it had done to the men inside the store, and in spite of the sickness I still felt burning in my guts.
  </p>
  <p>
  Its eyes bored into mine. Bright spots danced in the air, and the thing spoke again, after an eternity.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I need...your help.”
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  Communicating with it was difficult. Baking in the heat of the afternoon sun, the thing and I had a heart to heart before we left Bob's Gas and Fireworks and headed into the hungry desert.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What do I need to do?”
  </p>
  <p>
  I waited a full minute for it to reply, sweat dripping into my eyes, and the rough wooden planks of the bench digging into my legs.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Help me...make a...”
  </p>
  <p>
  It trailed off, and looked through the dusty screen window over my shoulder. I wondered if it was looking at Ernie’s corpse. Then it continued.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Transmission.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “A transmission?” I said. "Like you need to communicate with...”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yes,” it said, and smiled again. I think it meant to be reassuring. It wasn’t. That bone deep sickness had subsided, but I hadn’t gotten used to the ozone stink of the creature’s breath.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Are you an alien?”
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn't think it was a demon, or an angry spirit. That mostly left aliens. I always assumed life existed elsewhere in the universe, but I never imagined I'd be sweating my balls off in Nevada and having a conversation with an alien creature at gunpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You would...call it so...Yes.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I focused my gaze to the left of its face. Heat still radiated off its shoulders, and I realized its lank, greasy hair was slowly moving. As if stirred by a breeze.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Where are you from? How far?” My curiosity began to overtake my revulsion, now that I was fairly certain it wouldn’t kill me right away.
  </p>
  <p>
  It didn't reply. The thing leaned against a wooden post in front of me, swaying like a drunk. An orange butterfly landed in the bloody footprint on the porch. The insect slowly flapped its wings.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing wasn’t sweating, but the skin around its eyes and mouth seemed tighter. Like it was drying out.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was about to repeat my question when it gripped my left forearm.
  </p>
  <p>
  Its bony fingers sank into the flesh of my arm and the little sounds of the desert faded out. A steady rushing sound rose around me, and my ears popped like I was under water. My sinuses ached and the taste of salt was heavy on my tongue. It was the same sensation of pressure and depth I felt in the store, only worse.
  </p>
  <p>
  But the thing’s touch didn’t hurt like before. I found myself drifting on endless, indigo waters. A journey of incalculable distance. My body ached with loss, and a separation so sharp it was physical.
  </p>
  <p>
  I closed my eyes and I could see those indigo waters. I swam in a sea alive with creatures similar to myself. We were identical and distinct at once, and I knew each of my brothers and sisters by the paths they cut through dark blue water.
  </p>
  <p>
  The light of the desert struck me blind for a moment when the creature released my wrist.
  </p>
  <p>
  I gagged and coughed hard enough to make my ribs ache. The pressure in my head faded as I doubled over, heaving on the wooden planks of the porch. I stood on aching legs and considered my captor. It wasn’t as repulsive as it was before. Its black eyes were no less fascinating, but no longer filled me with dread. I found myself determined to help.
  </p>
  <p>
  It said a single word, as if its mind meld wasn't explanation enough.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Far.”
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing and I walked west through the scrubby desert along highway 50. It kept enough distance I didn’t get sick, but stayed close enough I heard the shuffling of its feet as it trudged through the dirt behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
  Just after sunset, I pulled the heavy flashlight out of my duffel and turned it on. The creature had moved steadily closer since we’d left Bob’s Gas and Fireworks behind. In the full darkness of night in the desert, I could have reached out and touched it. I don’t know if I had gotten used to being around it, or if it deactivated some kind of ray, but the proximity of the creature no longer made me nauseous. My stomach turned a somersault every now and then, but nothing like the crippling sickness the first time it touched me inside the store.
  </p>
  <p>
  “How much further do you want to go?” I asked. "I mean, you don't expect me to walk all night, do you?” I paused to stretch, my back crackling and the beam of the flashlight bouncing along the red dirt. The creature paused behind me, and I could feel it humming with energy.
  </p>
  <p>
  I wondered again if it was wearing a real human body, or if it was some kind of replica. A machine.
  </p>
  <p>
  Seconds stretched into minutes as I stood there in the dark, waiting for the thing to reply. It still wasn’t much of a conversationalist.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Not much farther…tonight,” it said. “Still a...long way to...”
  </p>
  <p>
  Its voice floated toward me before it fell silent once more. My legs were like stone, but we kept moving.
  </p>
  <p>
  About an hour later, the flashlight beam glinted off something in the dirt ahead of us. An old red Buick, abandoned on the side of the highway. I ran a finger through thick dust collected on the rear windshield, and the tip of my finger was black in the beam of my flashlight.
  </p>
  <p>
  The creature pulled up short behind me. The strange hum surrounding it seemed weaker. I rubbed the dust between my fingers, ready to keep walking through the night.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Stop,” it said.
  </p>
  <p>
  The creature stood unsteadily next to the car. Greasy hair framed a slack face with glassy eyes. It gripped my father’s pistol tightly in its left hand. With its right, it groped at the car. It missed and stumbled, nearly falling over, before catching hold of the rear fender.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You want to make camp here tonight?” I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing's face swiveled toward me, and I lowered my flashlight. I didn’t want to look into its eyes if I didn’t have to. It didn’t seem to be aware I’d asked it a question. In the flashlight beam, its jaw hung slack, gray teeth just visible behind dry and flaking lips. The familiar smell of ozone drifted toward me out of the dark circle of its mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
  Then recognition came back into its face. It stood up straighter and closed its mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yes, David. We'll...stay here. Tonight.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The inside of the Buick smelled like the inside of every old car that's spent a lot of time in the sun. Like hot baked plastic and dirt. I looked around for anything that might have made a home in the car, but other than a handful of antique fast food wrappers in the floorboard, it was empty. No snakes. No chupacabra.
  </p>
  <p>
  Real night had fallen around the two of us now, like a thick curtain. I had no idea what it was doing with me there in the desert. But it still hadn't killed me, and it seemed pleasant enough. Apart from shooting Bob and Ernie, I reminded myself.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Do you...want to sleep in the back seat?” I asked. I lowered the flashlight again. "Or we could both sleep outside.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing turned toward me, and I felt I was being studied beneath a high powered microscope. A little voice in the back of my head told me that wasn’t far from the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I won't sleep.” it said. “You take the car. Get some...rest. Big...day tomorrow.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing’s smile didn’t touch its eyes when its face split open and it showed me its gray teeth again. I realized it was attempting to make a joke. A little bit of humor to lighten the situation.
  </p>
  <p>
  The sound of my bag’s zipper was too loud in the enclosed space of the Buick. The beach towel was old and threadbare, but it worked ok as a makeshift blanket. The creature leaned against the car door. Pale, flabby flesh pressed against the glass where its shirt rode up.
  </p>
  <p>
  I imagined it standing watch as I slept, out in the dark, wearing that empty grin. It probably forgot to tell its body to stop smiling. I locked the door and curled up under the towel, my knees jammed on the console between the front seats.
  </p>
  <p>
  I didn’t expect to get any sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I jerked awake, banging my head against the door and my left shin on the back of the driver's seat. Fantastic. The day was off to a wonderful start. Sunlight filtered through the filthy windshield, and the inside of the car was uncomfortably warm.
  </p>
  <p>
  I sat up and rubbed the sore spot on my head. After repacking my bag, I stood in the early morning sun, groaning with relief as I stretched my aching back.
  </p>
  <p>
  The clock on my phone was frozen at 1:11. Still no signal. I put the useless thing back in my pocket.
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing sat cross legged on the hood of the car. All I could see was greasy hair and the back of its flabby arms. It turned to face me, and I didn't get that familiar feeling of creeping dread mingled with disgust. Something about it had changed as I slept.
  </p>
  <p>
  The skin in its face was less cracked and dried. It smiled, and the smile moved more naturally across its face. I got the impression it had grown into a set of ill fitting clothing.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Good morning, David,” it said. "I trust you slept well?”
  </p>
  <p>
  This tiny exchange came more easily than our conversations from the day before. Its voice was relaxed, and its teeth looked more like teeth, and less like crumbling charcoal bricks.
  </p>
  <p>
  It was more difficult to think of the being as an it. Except for its black, unblinking eyes, this could have been my mother. Or a favorite aunt.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah,” I say. “I slept great. The height of comfort.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing covered its mouth and laughed politely.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We won't be spending many more nights like this, I assure you. Just a little further to go. I believe we can make the transmission tonight, or early tomorrow morning, at the latest.”
  </p>
  <p>
  The highway stretched west ahead of us, lit by the sun crawling over the horizon. The weather was already too warm, and I fished my sunglasses out of a pocket in my bag.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You still haven't told me much about this transmission.” I said. “Or what happens to me once you've made it.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Once we've made it,” it said, gently correcting me. “I need your help. I wouldn't have asked you if I didn't need your help to make it.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “I don't recall you asking me, exactly.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well,” it said. “At least I didn't shoot you.” The thing laughed again, a warm, full throated giggle. There was nothing polite about that laugh. One of my favorite cousins laughed the same way.
  </p>
  <p>
  The creature still clutched my father’s .45 in its right hand. Its fingers had sunk into the textured grip. Like they’d melted right through the industrial grade rubber. This little detail reminded me it was not one of my aunts.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What's your name?” I asked. I wasn’t sure why I wanted to know.
  </p>
  <p>
  The creature turned away, and cocked its head to one side.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I don't really...have one,” it said, sounding sorry it didn’t have a name to give me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You don't have like a, serial number? Or a designation? Or anything like that?”
  </p>
  <p>
  A part of me was horrified I was standing around, cracking jokes with the thing. Less than a day ago it shot two men to death right in front of me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, nothing like that.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “What should I call you, then?”
  </p>
  <p>
  The creature paused for a few seconds. It looked over its shoulder at me, black eyes huge in its face.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Maria.”
  </p>
  <p>
  She didn't look like a Maria. More like a Lisa, or a Carol. The weird familiarity that had grown between us as I slept was unthinkable the night before.
  </p>
  <p>
  “All right,” I said. “Maria it is.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I fished two water bottles out of my duffel and offered one to Maria. She shook her head.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, thank you. I'm not thirsty.”
  </p>
  <p>
  She slid off the hood of the car, and the dent she left behind smoked in her absence.
  </p>
  <p>
  I had a hard time believing she wasn’t thirsty. She blocked the early morning sun in front of me, and the air around her shimmered with heat. I hadn't seen her drink anything since the apple juices at Bob's Gas and Fireworks. I put the other bottle back in the bag and drank mine in two long pulls.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well,” I said, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. “Shall we?”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Lead the way,” she said, and pointed down the road with the pistol.
  </p>
  <p>
  I shouldered my bag and started walking, my back already uncomfortably warm from the rising sun.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  The highway cut through the brittle Nevada desert in front of us. No one had passed us since we left Bob’s Gas and Fireworks. Not a single car or semi truck hauling dry goods. The two of us climbed a small rise in the ground and a shack slowly revealed itself over the horizon.
  </p>
  <p>
  I felt Maria behind me, walking along, keeping pace. Not the lurching steps she made when she stomped into my life the previous afternoon. Just normal walking sounds. Like a normal person.
  </p>
  <p>
  Not like an impostor.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria. The name she gave herself. The name rolled around in my mind, and I remembered how my mouth filled with slick animal panic at the first sight of her. Like she was something Not Of This Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
  But that was a lifetime ago. That was back at Bob’s. Now she was Maria.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Maria?” I ask.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yes, David?”
  </p>
  <p>
  She stopped, and I turned to face her. My father’s pistol hung limp at her side, like a forgotten toy.
  </p>
  <p>
  “How much longer do we have to go?”
  </p>
  <p>
  Her face went slack, big black eyes emptied when she checked out again. Or checked in, or whatever it is she did when she wasn’t there.
  </p>
  <p>
  I ran north across the highway, and I didn’t bother looking both ways when I crossed. My shoes dug into loose red dirt as I ran, and I found myself praying my feet wouldn’t find a hole or disturb a snake.
  </p>
  <p>
  Something tugged in my mind, but I couldn’t bear to check if she was following me. My chest ached as I drew closer to the old shack. I hoped someone lived there, even though Maria was behind me with the pistol.
  </p>
  <p>
  I choked on red dirt kicked up by my shoes, and a cramp in my guts almost knocked me to the ground. I dropped to my knees, violently sick. Worse than the day before when she touched my arm. I vomited up water and the granola bars I had for breakfast, and I didn’t stop until nothing came up but yellow stomach acid. I collapsed, and a tiny stream of vomit ran over my left thumb.
  </p>
  <p>
  And then she came to me, picking her way carefully through the dirt. I imagined her tracing the footsteps of my doomed escape attempt, casually raising the .45. My own blood and brains joining the pool of vomit, running over my thumb. I thought of Ernie. I thought of Bob, and his empty store.
  </p>
  <p>
  “David,” she said.
  </p>
  <p>
  My sickness lifted as soon as she spoke my name. The crippling nausea was cured immediately, just like the other day when she moved away from me. Completely gone.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What...the fuck?” I said. I coughed, a deep ragged cough, and wiped my hand on my pant leg.
  </p>
  <p>
  A little smile crawled across Maria’s face. Like we had a secret. Shit, maybe we did.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I don't think I'll need this anymore,” she said, and dropped the gun. My eyes traced the impression of her hand burned into the rough grip of my father’s pistol. I thought about picking it up, but it felt pointless. Like someone else’s bad idea.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Come on,” she says. “Let's go.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I followed Maria back through the desert, toward the highway.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria's pace quickened, and she moved smoothly through the desert in front of me, with none of her previous unsteadiness.
  </p>
  <p>
  We walked in silence, but I got the feeling our trek through the desert was almost over. We crested a gentle slope by the side of the highway, and I was certain our destination would reveal itself over the rise.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Not that close, David. But soon.” Maria’s voice was so soft and smooth I wasn't certain she said anything at all. I didn't question how she knew what I was thinking. That little tug in my mind was familiar, and I was too exhausted to be surprised by much. Funny how a couple of days through the desert at gunpoint will change your world view.
  </p>
  <p>
  I drank a bottle of water and stared at the sole of her bare foot, blackened with dried blood and dirt. Maria seemed to be unaware of her damaged foot. It didn’t slow her down.
  </p>
  <p>
  When I tossed the empty bottle to the side of the highway, I realized it’s the first water I’ve had all day. We’d been walking for hours in the sun, and I wasn't even that thirsty.
  </p>
  <p>
  We walked until the sun sank low in the sky, until Maria stopped in front of me. I immediately sat down on a nearby rock. I could barely stand, and I was used to her little disappearing act. I knew I’d get a few minutes to rest.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria cocked her head, just a little. Like she was thinking about a problem that wasn't difficult, but required some thought. Her body relaxed after a few moments, and I knew she had returned.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Feeling better? I know this has been hard for you.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Was that real concern in her voice? I almost thought so. I shook my head and wiped my forehead on the back of my arm. No sweat. Strange.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I'm all right,” I said. “Just sick of walking. I want to go home.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Christ, I sounded like a lost little kid. Not far from the truth, I guess.
  </p>
  <p>
  She crouched in front of me and rested her chin on top of her knees. Like she thought I was a kid, too.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Soon, David. We'll make the transmission, and then you can go home. I promise.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria smiled at me, and there was such real tenderness in her voice I smiled back. And her black eyes didn't look so dead.
  </p>
  <p>
  She stood and frowned, peeling something off the bottom of her bare foot. She inspected it in the fading afternoon light. A tiny brown scorpion, squashed flat somewhere along highway 50.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Now get up,” she said. “Break time's over.”
  </p>
  <p>
  She turned and headed west, back into the desert.
  </p>
  <p>
  The light of the setting sun blinded me until all I could see was her relentless silhouette.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  We crested another hill just after sunset, and a ruined campsite revealed itself in a shallow valley below. The campsite was three cinder blocks around a blackened circle in the ground. A red cooler with a broken handle rested against the one nearest to us. Most importantly, there was a sleeping bag half-buried in red dirt, pinned beneath a large rock.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria’s head eclipsed the setting sun when she stopped and turned toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Here we are. Home sweet home.” Her black eyes were lively, full of mirth. Like we shared a little joke. How did those eyes ever remind me of a shark's eyes?
  </p>
  <p>
  I laughed in response.
  </p>
  <p>
  “About fucking time. I'm beat.” I shrugged off the duffle and sat on one of the cinderblocks. Christ, it felt good to sit. I took off my shoes and rubbed my feet, wincing at the pain. My legs felt like blocks of wood, and I rubbed them until the feeling returned.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria hovered nearby, watching me with her head cocked to the side. Like she was considering something.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I bet you are. You should drink some water.” I felt the weight of her eyes on me again. My mouth was dry, but I wasn't thirsty.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Huh,” I say. “That's weird. I'm not really thirsty. What about you? You haven't had anything to drink since...”
  </p>
  <p>
  Something like regret or sadness crossed her face. Just for a moment, and then she was all smiles again.
  </p>
  <p>
  “No, thanks. That's very kind of you, but I'm not very thirsty either.”
  </p>
  <p>
  A silence fell between us while I massaged my aching muscles in the fading light.
  </p>
  <p>
  “So!” I said. There was a weird kind of cheer in my voice. “We're camping here tonight, I guess?”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yes,” she said. She sat on the cinder block next to me. A tingle shot up my knee when her bare leg brushed against mine. “Not much longer now.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “When will-”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Tomorrow morning. Late morning, maybe 11:30. It might be a little later than that, but we're very close now.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “Do you need to set something up? Some equipment or something? And what do you need me for?”
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria had been vague about the transmission since we left Bob’s Gas and Fireworks, and she wasn't carrying any equipment. Then again, I didn't have any idea how her race communicated with each other.
  </p>
  <p>
  She leaned forward on the cinderblock, looking into my eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  “In a manner of speaking, yes. Most of it is already arranged. It takes two to make the transmission. My partner was...killed, when we landed.”
  </p>
  <p>
  She looked down, and a strand of hair fell in front of her face. I caught something from her then, a feeling of uncountable loss and infinite distance. I wondered how far she was from home.
  </p>
  <p>
  The silence was easy. Comfortable. The kind found between old friends.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Maria,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  She looked up, and tucked the strand of hair back between one ear. Her eyes were huge, black and wet.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What am I going to have to do? I've agreed to help you, and I will. And I don't think you're going to kill me. But I want to know.”
  </p>
  <p>
  She didn't answer for a while.
  </p>
  <p>
  “There's a hill in the road ahead of us. Just outside an old fueling station. I don't think I can explain exactly how it works, but that's a good spot to finalize the transmission. It isn't something that is done all at once. It's a process.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria reached for my hand, and another tingle crept down my arm when her fingers crossed my palm. The spot where her leg had touched mine ached pleasantly. The thought that she drugged me through physical contact flickered across my mind.
  </p>
  <p>
  I saw the two of us standing on a hill in the middle of a light dust storm. Maria’s family would know how to find her when the two of us were on that hill tomorrow morning. The transmission was more similar to a blooming flower than a signal flare. I was still unclear about my role, but I got the gist of what she needed from me.
  </p>
  <p>
  It was something like being an antenna and strengthening her signal.
  </p>
  <p>
  She dropped my hand, and I found myself reaching for her. I folded my hands in my lap.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh,” I said. My head was too full.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yes,” she said and smiled again. “Tomorrow morning. We'll both be able to go home.”
  </p>
  <p>
  And I believed her. I thought about my parents, back home in Indiana. How happy my mom would be to see me. How I’d have to tell my dad what happened to his pistol. Sitting on a cinder block in the middle of the Nevada desert with an alien creature, my little house seemed impossibly distant.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You should get some rest, David. Tomorrow is the big day.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I opened a bottle of water, took a long pull and spat it out. I bought the pack before leaving home a couple weeks earlier, but the mouthful I spat on the ground was stagnant and foul. A foreign taste.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Goodnight,” I said, and stretched out on the sleeping bag.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria sat in silence, staring up at the night sky.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  I woke up before dawn. My body felt surprisingly good after a night spent half asleep in the dirt.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria was still sitting on the same cinderblock from the night before. Her gaze shifted toward me when I stood and stretched in the early morning dark.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Good morning, David,” she said, smiling. I no longer found her smile creepy or forced. We'd come too far for that over the last three days.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Morning. How did you sleep?” Maria didn't seem to get the joke. She cocked her head and shot me a look that said she knew I knew better.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Are you ready to go?”
  </p>
  <p>
  She stood and I expected to hear her joints cracking and popping, but her body was silent as a church.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ready when you are. We're almost done now.” She smiled again, and I could almost taste her eagerness.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Let's go. I just need to grab my bag.”
  </p>
  <p>
  A part of me wasn’t sure why I still bothered with my duffel, since I’d barely had anything to eat or drink in the last day or so. I wasn’t hungry that final morning, and the thought of bottled water made my stomach turn.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Lead the way,” I said. She did.
  </p>
  <p>
  <hr />
  </p>
  <p>
  The day dawned gray and flat. The sun peeked out briefly, but mostly it stayed hidden behind a monotonous cloud cover. Maria and I walked side by side down the crumbling highway together, in silence.
  </p>
  <p>
  An hour later, a rabbit scurried across the road in front of us. Maria and I tracked its path, our heads swiveling in unison. The rabbit darted into a hole and once it disappeared, our eyes met and we smiled at each other. Was I ever really afraid she'd kill me? Was I still afraid she'd kill me? The idea seemed ludicrous.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria spoke after a few more minutes of walking.
  </p>
  <p>
  “The rest area is just ahead. You should stop and clean up. We're almost where we need to be.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I'd forgotten our journey would end at some point. I'd forgotten we wouldn't spend the rest of our lives wandering through the desert. I'd forgotten Maria and I were both trying to get home, and she still needed my help.
  </p>
  <p>
  Cleaning up sounded like a fantastic idea. I was suddenly aware of how dirty I was, covered in sweat and grit from the road. I couldn't smell myself, but I was positive I stank. Not that Maria cared one way or another.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sure,” I said. “That sounds great. How much...” I wasn’t sure how to phrase the question.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We'll be there shortly. Look,” she said, and pointed at a squat, gray building with one thin finger.
  </p>
  <p>
  At one point it was a gas station. Probably the number one competitor for Bob's Gas and Fireworks.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maria climbed a small rise in the earth, her eyes searching the cloud cover. I walked around the side of the building and tried the handle of the men's room. Locked.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Figures,” I muttered.
  </p>
  <p>
  I circled back around to the small store, looking behind an ancient desk.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Aha!” I said, and held up a length of wood attached to a brass key.
  </p>
  <p>
  The ceiling in the men’s room had caved in, and I didn't bother trying the light switch.
  </p>
  <p>
  The mirror above the sink was black with disuse, but the water still worked. The faucet sputtered and released a brown torrent gradually clearing to a light tan.
  </p>
  <p>
  I scrubbed my hands and forearms, then bent to wash my face.
  </p>
  <p>
  I wiped away enough grime off the mirror to look at myself. In the dim morning light filtering down through the ruined ceiling, I stared back at myself with solid black eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  I made a lot of connections quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
  Somewhere in the air, miles above us, I felt something open. A huge awareness, overjoyed to have found its wayward children at last. A choir of voices joyfully calling us back home.
  </p>
  <p>
  I walked out of the bathroom and joined Maria on top of the hill, in the middle of a swirling dust storm.
