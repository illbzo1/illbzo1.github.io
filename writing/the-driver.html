  <h1><small id="small-header">The Driver</small></h1>
  <p>
  The trip down to Louisville took two hours, maybe an hour forty five if I got into a thing. I didn’t get into a thing when Little Joe and I drove down earlier this afternoon, though. Just over two hours in the car, breathing in cheap weed and Joe’s taco farts. I’d been waiting for Little Joe in the parking garage where we met our supplier for the last hour and a half. Little Joe was late.
  </p>
  <p>
  The garage gave me the creeps. Something was wrong with the overhead lights. I was fucking around on my phone when something banged against the passenger side door, making me jump in my seat. Little Joe grinned through the open window, showing off a mouth full of little gray teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
  He slowly pushed a mason jar full of yellow pills up so I could see them. His grin widened, and he Joe danced out of the way when I opened the door. Little Joe clutched the jar with dirty nails, and shook it like a maraca. He hooted, and his voice echoed in the garage.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe slid into the seat beside me. His face was sweaty, dark hair plastered to his forehead.
  </p>
  <p>
  I never went upstairs to meet our supplier. Joe’s supplier, really. I just drove and waited.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You were in there a long time,” I said. “Everything ok?"
  </p>
  <p>
  He nodded and licked his lips. Little Joe planted the jar in his crotch, and his hands circled the lid, squeezing and rubbing.
  “Yeah,” he said. “We’re good. Drive."
  </p>
  <p>
  I popped the clutch and looked over my shoulder. The garage was mostly empty. Two, maybe three other cars. I expected to see one of them flip on its lights and ease out of its space. Ready to follow us north across state lines.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Let’s go, already,” he said. Little Joe unscrewed the lid and took out a single pill. He rolled it between his fingers, squinting at the crumbly little thing. It left a chalky dust between Joe’s fingers.
  </p>
  <p>
  “They don’t look like the last ones,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Hold on,” he said. “I’m gonna.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe rolled the pill between his fingers until it crumbled, and sprinkled the dust on the web of his left hand. He bent and snorted, one strong toot, then threw his head back. His eyes rolled back and his mouth hung open.
  </p>
  <p>
  He always snorted one when we made a pick up. Little Joe never could stand the taste of pills, but he had to sample. One pill every week for the last three years. I got one later, when we got home. We usually stayed up the rest of the day, listening to music in my apartment, playing Playstation.
  </p>
  <p>
  It was almost like when we were kids. Little Joe dug around in the trash in the floorboard of my car, and found a half full bottle of water. He drank it down, then tossed the bottle out the window. It bounced twice, then rolled and came to rest against a pillar.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It’s the same stuff,” he said. “Or mostly the same. You know how this shit goes."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  I idled at the gate and plugged in three crisp bills I picked up at the bank earlier that afternoon. We called it tuckin money, but we almost never went to the strip club after a pickup anymore. Little Joe got real businesslike over the last few months. Some of the higher ups had changed, but I didn’t know more than that. He still hadn’t brought me up, after all. I was still waiting in the parking garage every time we made a pickup.
  </p>
  <p>
  A little red light on the side of the machine turned green, and I eased my car underneath the raised gate onto an empty street. I looked back over my shoulder one more time. Just in case.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe rubbed and pulled on his nose, then banged on his chest until he burped. He laughed, that stupid donkey laugh of his. Too loud in the car, even with the windows down. I turned on the stereo.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Excuse me!” he said. “Fuck, I wish I could learn how to swallow pills. That shit’s fucking up my sinus cavity, Eddie. Hey, remember that time we got them mescaline pills? And everything got all purple?"
  </p>
  <p>
  "Haha, yeah," I said, and grinned. I pretended to check my teeth in the rearview. Nobody was following us, but I didn't feel like we were alone. Nobody had ever followed out of Louisville. I still checked every time we left that garage, just in case. Like I said. That place gave me the creeps, and I liked to be safe. I drove through crumbling downtown streets. Headed toward the bridge. I was ready to cross the river and get the fuck out of Kentucky.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Lighten up, Eddie,” he said. “Stop checking the fucking rear view.”
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe rubbed yellow dust from his fingers into his gums. He checked his own teeth in the rearview, then slouched low in his seat.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We’ve done this a thousand times. It ain’t even a thing anymore. We’re gonna get home, get some donuts, then go back to your place, right? Tomorrow meet up with them frat boys. Right?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah,” I said. “Right. I know. I dunno, man, I just been smoking like a fucking ton of weed lately. Making me more paranoid."
  </p>
  <p>
  “You oughtta lay off that shit, then,” said Little Joe. “At least when we got a pick up. You’re making me nervous."
  </p>
  <p>
  Weed was ok for Joe when we made a pickup, I guess. My car stank of his dirty skunkweed, even though I had the windows down the entire time I waited for him to come back downstairs.
  </p>
  <p>
  He turned the stereo up until I couldn’t hear anything but the bass. It felt good. I liked driving like that, back home through the dark, heavy bass rubbing my bones to jelly.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe was usually a lot more excitable after a pick up, but he wasn’t saying much. His baseball cap sat on the knee of his new jeans, and his thin black hair stood up in spikes on his head. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, even though the AC was on and the display read a cool 71 degrees inside the car.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You feeling alright?” I asked. Little Joe scratched at the back of his head, and I caught a whiff of something when he moved. An sour smell. Kind of like an old refrigerator.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe rolled up both windows, then turned the AC down. He twisted his nose back and forth again, and sniffed. Something gurgled deep inside him.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I think it’s that pill, man,” he said. “Time’s getting weird. You got any more water?"
  </p>
  <p>
  His voice was dry. Like he was 80 years old. Little Joe cracked his knuckles and turned the volume down on the stereo. Way down. Usually he wanted the stereo so loud we couldn’t hear each other. Especially after a pick up.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Uh, yeah man, let me look,” I said. I checked the odometer, and flipped on the cruise control. I liked driving fast, but not when we were on our way back from Louisville. I pulled a full bottle of water out of a pack in the backseat.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Here,” I said. My eyes flickered between him and the highway in front of us until he took the bottle from me. He unscrewed the cap and drank most of it. Little Joe poured some water into his left hand, and rubbed it into his hair.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, that’s better,” he said. “Listen, you might need to pull over up there. I’m too fucking hot, man."
  </p>
  <p>
  My eyes slid up to the rear view. A pair of headlights behind us, way back in the darkness. Probably nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Uh yeah, ok,” I said. “There’s a gas station up ahead. I can stop there, if you want."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok, good,” said Little Joe. His voice gurgled like his lungs were full of water, and he pulled off his shirt. Sweat covered his chest. “That fucking pill, man."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Must’ve been something new,” I said. “Usually you can handle one pill. How else you feeling?"
  </p>
  <p>
  The car behind us got closer. I rubbed the steering wheel, twisting my hands around the plastic.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Real hot, man. And like, I dunno,” he said. “Crawly."
  </p>
  <p>
  The other car sped up and passed on the right. An old blue boxy car. The kind my dad used to like. I swallowed, and stopped fucking with the steering wheel.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What do you mean, crawly?” I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe was quiet for a long time.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I dunno, man,” he said. “Just drive. I can’t think straight. And turn that shit off."
  </p>
  <p>
  I turned the stereo off, and we fell into silence for a while. It was still late. Not even 4 yet. The donut place opened at 5:30. We always got back just in time to get a dozen fresh glazed donuts. Little Joe’s favorite. The crew at the donut shop knew us. We were regulars, and it felt good to be regulars.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe slumped further down in his seat. The vinyl behind him was wet with stinking sweat. Like that smell from earlier, but worse. I cracked my window.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Joe,” I said. His head rolled against the passenger side door.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Joe, wake up man,” I said, and reached toward him. Little Joe’s hand shot out, and gripped my wrist so tight I heard bones creak.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Fuck, man!” I said, and tried to pull away.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I’m fine, Eddie,” he said, and rolled his head toward me. The whites of his eyes were streaked with yellow. Little Joe pulled his lips into a grin, and his teeth were too long. Still gray, but bigger. Like his gums were pulling away. He let go of my wrist, and pushed himself back up in his seat. His skin made a wet noise when it moved against the vinyl.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Just drive, man,” he said. “That’s what you get paid for."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Sure man, ok,” I said. I pushed my knees under the steering wheel to keep it steady, and rubbed my wrist. I didn’t think the bones were broken, but red marks in the shape of Joe’s fingers circled my wrist. “You feeling better? You want some more water?"
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe stared at the dark fields lining the side of the interstate. I kept my knees under the steering wheel, and a light switched on in a house on the horizon. Someone in one of those shitty tract houses, getting ready for his shitty factory job. Or a farmer.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You ever think about the people who live in those houses, Eddie?” he asked. Little Joe’s voice was a croak. He sounded like he was a thousand years old.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What do you mean?” I asked. Little Joe’s forehead rolled against the glass, and his hands gripped his thighs.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Keep your eyes on the road, Eddie,” he growled. He licked his lips and grinned. Little Joe’s hands dug into the meat of his thighs, clenched and pulled, clenched and pulled. His forehead smeared grease along the window.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, ok,” I said. “No, I don’t really think about them, man. Farmers, probably. Or factory workers."
  </p>
  <p>
  “Little people, you could say,” he said. “Living little lives, out there in the dark."
  </p>
  <p>
  I hoped for a mile marker. Time had gotten weird for me, too, and paranoia crept up. It wasn’t the weed. The road ticked by under the car.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Joe, you feelin alright, man? You don’t uh, you don’t look. So good,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe peeled his forehead off the window.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Look at me,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Joe, I’m drivin, man,” I said. My peripheral vision was good, and I didn’t want to look at Little Joe. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, my hands at 10 and 2. Felt good to be doing something like I was supposed to.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Look at me, you shit,” he said, and something in his voice made me do what he said. Something made me turn my head and look at him.
  </p>
  <p>
  It wasn’t the guy I’d known since 8th grade. Not anymore. Something else sat in Little Joe’s seat, wearing his new jeans, and grinning at me with long, gray teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe’s eyes bulged out of skin pulled tight on his face. They were both completely yellow. No whites. Just tiny black pupils that looked wrong somehow. They were rectangular, like a horse’s pupils. I rode a horse once when I was in elementary school. Another kid in my class lived on a farm, and we took a field trip to his house. I remember thinking about how
  </p>
  <p>
  “fucking huge the horses were,” said Little Joe. “Shut up about the fucking horse, Eddie. I need you to focus here."
  </p>
  <p>
  I hadn’t said anything. I knew I hadn’t said anything. But I nodded and tried to turn my head away. To get my eyes back on the road, but I couldn’t move. Still, I had good peripherals, and we were alone on the highway.
  </p>
  <p>
  “But yeah, Eddie,” he said, and his grin stretched even wider. His lips were dry, and cracked at the corners of his mouth. “I feel all right. I’ve never felt better."
  </p>
  <p>
  That grin made me feel sick all over. Like the time I got food poisoning from a bad batch of fried chicken.
  </p>
  <p>
  “These are some fucking pills, man,” he said, and gurgled low in his throat. He sounded worse than before, like my grandma did one year when she got pneumonia. Like Little Joe’s lungs were full of water. The thing in the seat next to me stopped talking, but it held me there. Just staring at me with yellow eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Now get your eyes back on the fucking road,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah man, ok,” I said. My neck ached, and my chest hurt when I took a deep breath. Little Joe sat straight up in his seat, rubbing his left arm. He pulled his skin like he was pulling on his jeans earlier. The air in the car car stank like his sweat, but worse. It was something almost familiar that I couldn’t place.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We’re gonna make a lot of money,” he whispered. “Yes. Yes, I promise. We’re gonna make a lot of money."
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe rocked back and forth in his seat, rubbing his arm. Whispering to himself.
  </p>
  <p>
  We passed a mile marker. Only 41 miles left until we got to the donut shop. That meant a little less than an hour until we pulled into the parking lot. I tried not to think about what would happen when we got there while Little Joe squirmed and whispered to himself, rubbing at his arm. And then he went quiet again. He leaned forward, and threw up into the pile of fast food wrappers and trash in the floorboard.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh, man, no, not in the car,” I said. I forgot what was happening for a second and turned around, digging in the back seat. Looking for napkins, or an old shirt. Anything.
  </p>
  <p>
  His hand closed around my throat. Something tickled at first, then stung. Like that hand was covered in tiny hairs.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Stop,” he growled. His face was just an inch or two from mine, and that old refrigerator stink came from him. His breath. All I could see was big yellow eyes, and my own face reflected in strange black pupils.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You just get me where I need to go,” said Little Joe, and he squeezed once. My vision went black, and then he let go.
  </p>
  <p>
  I turned back around and coughed. My chest still hurt from before. Bright yellow puke dripped from the edge of his seat into the floor. It smoked when it hit the vinyl seat, hissing and bubbling.
  </p>
  <p>
  “We’re almost there,” he said. Little Joe scooted forward. The puke rolled down, soaking into his jeans. I kept my eyes on the road in front of us and stayed quiet. I tried to concentrate on the road ticking away beneath us, as we passed another sign that said we were 22 miles out.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You ever feel like one of those houses back there, Eddie?” he asked. I tried to keep my eyes forward, but something forced me to look at him again. Just like last time. My neck moved on its own, and my eyes swiveled toward the thing in the passenger seat.
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe stared at me with those big yellow eyes. Strange, rectangular pupils. They weren’t glowing in the dark, not exactly. But it was like Little Joe was lit from the inside. Like he was a jack o’lantern.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Uh, I dunno, man,” I said. I tried to laugh, but only a little squeak came out. “What do you mean?"
  </p>
  <p>
  “Those houses. We passed back there, on the highway,” said Little Joe. “The shitty ones where the farmers live. Do you ever feel like one of them? Like you’re just empty, out there in the dark?"
  </p>
  <p>
  He breathed in my face again, and the car was full of the stink of him. My uncle owned an auto shop, and one time I found a dead frog in a bucket of old motor oil. Little Joe’s breath smelled like that. Like something long dead in a chemical bath.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Joe, I uh, gotta drive, man. Gotta get you where you’re going,” I said. He kept me there for a few more seconds. Not saying anything. Just staring at me with his yellow horse eyes, and breathing. That gurgling sound in his chest was louder. It sounded like the air hurt him.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I thought so,” he said. “Yeah, man. You go ahead. You drive me there."
  </p>
  <p>
  We drove the last 20 miles or so in silence. I counted down the seconds in my head while Little Joe rocked back and forth in the seat next to me, digging at his arms. Leaving bloody tracks down past his elbows, and whispering. His nose bled down to his chin, but he didn’t try to wipe it, or stop the bleeding. I didn’t say anything when it dripped onto the car seat.
  </p>
  <p>
  The little crescent sign above the donut shop was dark when I pulled up, but the crew was moving around inside. A cashier flipped the CLOSED sign to OPEN and waved at us through the glass. The sign lit up, and Little Joe unbuckled his seat belt.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You ready?” asked Little Joe. His tongue hung out of his mouth like a dead snake. He licked his lips, just once. The sound of his tongue scraping across his dry and cracked skin made my skin crawl. I killed the engine.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah man,” I said. “But first."
  </p>
  <p>
  Little Joe narrowed his yellow eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Let me get one of them pills,” I said. I didn’t know I was going to say it until it was out and hanging in the stinking air between me and Little Joe. His eyes brightened, and the skin around his mouth cracked and bled when he grinned. His mouth was all teeth now, and Little Joe started laughing. A thick, liquid sound.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Now we’re getting somewhere,” he said. Little Joe spun the lid off the jar of pills.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Take your pick,” he said.
