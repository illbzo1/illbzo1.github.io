  <h1><small id="small-header">I Should've Waited for Teddy</small></h1>
  <p>
  My leg was definitely broken.
  </p>
  <p>
  I sat on a dirty wooden floor in an old farmhouse, my right leg twisted below the knee. I imagined I could see my ankle swelling through the thick socks I wore when I explored abandoned houses. And maybe it wasn’t just my imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Oh, fuck, Christ,” I said, drawing a long slow breath in through my teeth. It didn’t ease the pain, or calm the panic gurgling in my stomach.
  </p>
  <p>
  I cursed the hole in the ceiling, and the rotten floor in the bathroom above where I’d stopped to make a series of photos of a spectacularly ruined sink. I’d stepped to the side to reframe a shot, and the bathroom floor just gave way.
  </p>
  <p>
  The ceiling was maybe 10 feet above me. I’d cracked my leg on a wood-burning stove on the way down, and landed outside the kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
  The floor in front of me had collapsed long ago, sloping into the basement. My phone lay face down on the basement floor, just beyond the edge of the ruined first story floor. The fall could have been worse.
  </p>
  <p>
  When I shifted my weight to get a better look at my broken leg, the pain was so intense I thought I would throw up and pass out. Hopefully in that order. </p>
  </p>
  <p>
  I remembered a sickening dry snap below my knee when I hit the wood stove, and I was pretty sure my leg was broken in at least two places. Luckily, I didn’t seem to have any deep cuts or punctures from the fall. Just a few scratches on my belly, and a badly broken leg.
  </p>
  <p>
  My camera came to rest just in front of the sloping floor. I pulled off my respirator, and switched the camera on. The LCD was cracked, but the camera seemed fine. Ok. Good.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Fuck,” I said. “I should’ve waited for Teddy.”
  </p>
  <p>
  My voice carried strangely in the darkness below. A little echo from below repeated my younger brother’s name.
  </p>
  <p>
  First things first. I had to get my phone to call my brother, and I had to splint my leg if I was going to move. Even then, I wasn’t sure I wanted to try the collapsed floor. It seemed stable enough, but I’d explored enough abandoned houses to know looks could be deceiving. Shit, I thought the bathroom floor was just fine 10 minutes ago.
  </p>
  <p>
  The kitchen was probably my best bet for building a splint. I’d passed through on my way upstairs, stopping to take a shot of a mouse skeleton resting in a cereal bowl. There was a juice glass sitting next to the bowl, and the sink was full of dishes. It seemed like the previous owner left in a hurry. Most of the doors had fallen off their cabinets, and old cereal boxes stood on top of the fridge. Cereal I hadn’t seen since I was a kid. King Vitamin. When was the last time I even had a bowl of King Vitamin?
  </p>
  <p>
  “Stop it,” I said. I needed to start thinking about making a splint.
  </p>
  <p>
  I needed a couple pieces of straight, sturdy material. Wood or metal would be best. And something to tie them together. I was briefly a Boy Scout when I was a kid. I was never Eagle Scout material, but I remembered some basic first aid. I hoped I did, anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
  There was no way I could put any weight on my right leg. I scooted toward the kitchen on my butt, screaming once when the bones in my leg ground together. I was right about the break. The pain from my ankle was a dull throb, and my knee was on fire.
  </p>
  <p>
  Another weird echo drifted up from the basement. My scream, probably. Though it was early afternoon, I could barely see the far edge of the basement. The edge of my phone was just visible in the gloom below. Out of reach for now.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You fucker,” I said, and continued working my way into the kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
  Twenty minutes later I sat in front of the lower cabinets, out of breath and rooting around for something I could use to stabilize my leg. The ceiling above the sink had caved in, and I kept an eye out for falling debris. A concussion was the last thing I needed.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Aha, there you are,” I said, pulling a large roll of plastic wrap out from a cabinet next to the stove. It’d work for binding. The card table opposite the fridge looked like a likely suspect for splint material.
  </p>
  <p>
  I took a few deep breaths. I wasn’t ready for another bone grinding trip across the kitchen floor on my ass.
  </p>
  <p>
  It only took another ten minutes to scoot across the red and orange linoleum. I tilted the table, and turned my head when the dishes slid off, bouncing away on the linoleum floor. Sorry, little mouse. I turned the table over, and my phone rang from the basement.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Where the fuck were you an hour ago, Ted?"
  </p>
  <p>
  I’d already wasted enough time getting into the kitchen. My brother knew where I was, and he knew I’d check in if I could. But I couldn’t count on him to come rescue me. I fished out a multitool I kept in my pocket, and after a few minutes I had two table legs lying on the floor in front of me. Good enough for a makeshift splint, assuming my boy scout training held up.
  </p>
  <p>
  I opened the box of plastic wrap and took another deep, calming breath.
  </p>
  <p>
  “This is going to hurt,” I said. “And don’t be surprised when it does. You might pass out. And this doesn’t have to be perfect. We just need to be able to kind of hobble around. Ok?"
  </p>
  <p>
  I couldn’t feel the toes on my right foot. Probably not a good sign.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok,” I said. “Here goes.”
  </p>
  <p>
  It didn’t take long to find the break below my knee. I screamed, and cursed the bathroom floor, my brother, my cell phone, and everything I could think of.
  </p>
  <p>
  My vision swam and I rode high on a wave of nausea as I muscled the bones back into place.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Round one is done,” I said. My breath whistled in my ears, and I licked a drop of sweat off my nose. “You ready for round two?"
  </p>
  <p>
  I tried wiggling my toes. Nothing. I tried harder, and saw an encouraging twitch inside my shoe.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok, ready,” I said. I pulled my foot to the left, back where it was supposed to go. The pain was exquisite. Worse than the first break, and sharper than anything else in my life.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’m not sure I didn’t pass out when I felt the fragile bones in my ankle slide reluctantly back into place. The house seemed darker. It might have been a trick brought on by extreme pain, or I might have lost a few minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
  The cereal bowl lay upside down next to my good leg. I didn’t see the little skeleton anywhere. I laid the table legs on either side of my leg, and unspooled a big sheet of plastic wrap.
  </p>
  <p>
  After twenty minutes or so I had a serviceable splint going. Like I said, I was never much of a boy scout, but it felt pretty good.
  </p>
  <p>
  “You ready for the fun part?” I asked. I pulled the wooden chair away from the table, and positioned it behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Yeah, this is going to be fucking great,” I said. I slowly pulled myself up off the floor, using the chair to keep my balance. The splint held, but my right leg felt like someone else’s leg. Like a stranger.
  </p>
  <p>
  I stuffed an old broom under my right arm. It would do as a crutch. Now I just had to make my way into the basement and get my phone.
  </p>
  <p>
  I hobbled back to the collapsed floor. My phone was lying face up on the concrete floor. The last hour or so had been weird, but I was certain my phone was face down when I headed into the kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Hello?” I called. My voice echoed, bouncing off the deep shadows at the far edge of the basement. I couldn’t see the wall across from the collapsed floor. Just a solid black curtain a few feet behind my phone, and I wondered if I was having vision problems on top of everything else that had gone wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Is someone down there?"
  </p>
  <p>
  I leaned against the bannister of the stairway leading upstairs. No answer. I was probably misremembering, and I shook my head. I took a deep breath, and then another.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok, here I come,” I said, and my phone rang again. In the dim light cast by the screen, something flinched and retreated into the darkness of the basement. A thing that squirmed and shrank away from the light. A bright flush of panic rose from my guts and lodged in my throat.
  </p>
  <p>
  “What the fuck,” I said, stumbling away from the edge of the collapsed floor. I banged my elbow on the bannister, and almost fell on my ass in the narrow doorway leading into the kitchen. </p>
  </p>
  <p>
  <p>  My phone continued to ring. Just beyond the circle of dim light cast by the phone, a pair of bright yellow eyes gleamed in the darkness. I hobbled back into the kitchen, and made it to the sink just in time to vomit. It was the pain, I told myself. In another hour or so, I’d know better, but just then I blamed it on the pain.
  </p>
  <p>
  “It was just a raccoon,” I said, wiping my chin. I spit into the sink. “Or a dog."
  </p>
  <p>
  But it wasn’t, and I knew it. Those eyes weren’t reflecting the light. They were glowing, like something lit from the inside.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok, fuck that,” I said. “We’re not going down there, dog or no dog. What else could we do?"
  </p>
  <p>
  I’m not a brave man. I knew I should just leave. Just bug the fuck out, and get another phone.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Ok, yeah,” I said. I patted my pockets, looking for my keys. They jangled in the right pocket of the light jacket I wore, and I nodded. Finally some good news.
  </p>
  <p>
  Something scraped against the concrete downstairs, and I heard a creak from the collapsed floor. I didn’t need any more convincing.
  </p>
  <p>
  I made my way past the stairwell and through the old fashioned French doors to the big wraparound porch. I didn’t look down the ruined floor. I didn’t want to see whatever lurked in the darkness crawling up to meet me. I kept my eyes on my little blue car, safe and sound in the overgrown gravel driveway.
  </p>
  <p>
  It took forever to get in the driver’s seat. I carefully lifted my right foot over the seat, settling it in the floorboard. I’d have to use my left foot to drive.
  </p>
  <p>
  I fumbled with the key, finally jamming it into the ignition, and turned. Nothing. I tried again, pumping the gas, but the car was dead. Of course the car was dead. Why wouldn’t it be?
  </p>
  <p>
  I turned the key harder, like I could wake it up. Like my car was pretending to be dead, just playing a funny joke on me, ha ha. But the engine was silent as a tomb.
  </p>
  <p>
  I sat in the car for a few minutes, weighing my options. My brother knew where I was. Ted found the house a couple weeks back. He was supposed to be with me today, but flaked out. Again. So who knew where the fuck Ted was. I’m sure he was sending a lot of well written apologies by text.
  </p>
  <p>
  I hadn’t passed any neighbors on the 45 minute drive here. Google Maps told me this was the only house for miles. And I wasn’t going to be walking anywhere with my busted leg.
  </p>
  <p>
  But fuck it, I’m not proud. Calling for help seemed like my best option.</p>
  </p>
  <p>
  <p>  I stood in the old gravel driveway and screamed for help. I screamed until my throat was raw, and no one came. No one answered, and I knew it was just me and the thing in the basement.
  </p>
  <p>
  I could always wait for Teddy, but he had a bad habit of disappearing. Sometimes for hours, and sometimes for days. I had to get my phone unless I wanted to be stuck here after dark,
  </p>
  <p>
  A breeze rustled through the branches of the trees surrounding the gravel parking lot, and I realized there weren’t any birds singing. It was late spring. The woods surrounding the farmhouse should have been lousy with birds. But the trees were silent. No birds singing. No little creatures stirring in the tall grass bent by the wind.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’d been exploring abandonments for a couple years now, and I liked to come prepared. Like the Boy Scouts said, right? I pulled a heavy metal flashlight out of a milk crate in the trunk. The beam was strong. Good. I tucked it into the waistband of my pants, and picked up my tire iron.
  </p>
  <p>
  I tightened my clumsy left-handed grip around the tire iron, and batted at the air above the trunk of my car. My swings felt wrong, but there wasn’t much I could do about it. I just had to break my right leg.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’d fallen through enough rotten floorboards for one day. Walking down the collapsed floor was out of the question. But I saw an exterior stairway to the basement when I circled the old house earlier. I shut the trunk and headed to the east side of the house.
  </p>
  <p>
  The concrete steps were slick with old leaves, and I took my time climbing down to the small landing at the bottom. A rusted white metal door lead into the basement. It was barred with a heavy padlock.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Fucking great,” I said.
  </p>
  <p>
  There was a symbol of some kind painted on the door in angry red, just below a filthy window. It looked fresh. Like it might have been painted before I showed up that morning. I reached out a finger to touch the paint, then closed my hand into a fist. The mark was like three triangles stacked against each other, with their points converging in an X pattern in the center. It gave me the creeps. I’d never seen it before, but the mark was familiar in a way I can’t explain.
  </p>
  <p>
  Through the narrow window, I could barely make out the light coming from the first floor. The padlock was locked tight.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Well, what did I expect?” I said. I backed up, my left foot sliding in the muck coating the landing, and swung at the lock. The tire iron bounced off the door, and my elbow sang from the force of the impact. I ignored my elbow, swinging again and again until the latch popped and the lock fell off.
  </p>
  <p>
  The door swung open toward me, as if in greeting. I stepped away, suddenly fearful of the red paint touching my skin. I stood in front of the open doorway, balanced awkwardly with my good left foot on the rotten wooden threshold. The basement was darker still, the shadows deeper, even though the sun wouldn’t set for another few hours. The underbelly of the house stank like an animal. A hot, rancid smell.
  </p>
  <p>
  Something watched me from the darkness.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I just want my phone, you fuck,” I called. No strange little echo that time. The basement swallowed up my voice.
  </p>
  <p>
  Murky light filtered down from the floor above. Like the basement was underwater. My phone lay on the floor in front of me, maybe fifteen feet away.
  </p>
  <p>
  The steady beam of my flashlight cut through the darkness. Encouraged, I took a step into the basement. Then another. I swept the beam around. The basement was larger than it seemed from upstairs. I couldn’t see the wall opposite the rusty metal door.
  </p>
  <p>
  There was a rustling sound ahead of me. That scraping noise I heard earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Hello?” I called. “Anyone there?"
  </p>
  <p>
  But there wasn’t, and I knew it.
  </p>
  <p>
  I wanted to run in, grab the phone, and get the fuck out. It wasn’t that far away, and there wasn’t anything in my way. The floor was surprisingly clean. I took another step away from the door, and two bright yellow eyes opened up in a distant corner. Something launched itself at me.
  </p>
  <p>
  I screamed and a tear opened in my raw throat. I choked on the taste of my blood as I swung the light toward the thing, hoping to ward it off. The thing avoided the beam of the flashlight, but it didn’t stop or retreat. It kept coming, scurrying close to the floor on too many legs.
  </p>
  <p>
  The creature was covered in something like hair, or fur. The noise of it moving across the concrete toward me made my teeth hurt. It mumbled as it came, a constant, eager sound. I caught bits of words I could understand. Curse words, my brother’s name, a rough parody of my own voice as those big yellow eyes drew closer.
  </p>
  <p>
  I balanced on my broom, bristles digging into my armpit, and swung the flashlight again. Something like a filament or a wire wrapped tight around my wrist. The flashlight cut out immediately, and I dropped it. The filament withdrew, tickling against my palm as it went, and the yellow eyes closed. I wasn’t bleeding, but my arm was numb to the elbow. My fingers refused to close when I tried to make a fist.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Phone. Grab your phone, you idiot,” I said. I was sure it would be gone, but there it was, lying at the base of the ruined floor. I leaned the broom against a stack of boxes, and tightened my grip on the tire iron. I bent carefully at the waist, and picked up my phone.
  </p>
  <p>
  No signal. Why wasn’t I surprised? I slid it into my pocket, picked up my broom, and turned back toward the door.
  </p>
  <p>
  The door was shut, and now that my eyes had adjusted to the dark, I saw the skeletons lining the cinderblock wall. Mostly little bones. A few that looked like cats or dogs.
  </p>
  <p>
  And one larger skeleton, partially hidden behind a couple of wooden boxes near the door. Maybe the previous owner didn’t leave in a hurry, after all.
  </p>
  <p>
  A skittering, scraping noise came from behind me. I turned, and raised the tire iron just in time to catch the thing as it leapt once more out of the thick darkness. The thing grunted when I hit it with the tire iron. Its body felt insubstantial, almost weightless, but it fell to the ground in front of me.
  </p>
  <p>
  I got a better look at the creature in the basement, lit by muddy light filtering down from the floor above. It was covered in something like thick hair that crawled and squirmed like worms. It shook like a dog, spraying foul smelling fluid on the floor, and scrambled toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
  My makeshift crutch snapped as I stumbled away from the creature’s awful gaze. I fell, banging my busted leg against a wooden box by the door. The thing lashed the air with its filaments, mumbling louder, grinding a multi segmented jaw full of needles.
  </p>
  <p>
  I clenched my jaw so hard I thought my teeth would crumble in my mouth, and raised the tire iron again. The thing scrambled up the wall and leapt toward me. I raised the sharp end of the tire iron, putting it between us.
  </p>
  <p>
  It impaled itself on the tire iron, its body sliding down the metal shaft, segmented jaws snapping and grinding inches from my fingers. The creature’s eyes flared, so bright I had to turn my head. I felt a sick heat as it inched toward me, and then the light began to fade. Like I’d turned off a gas powered lamp. I sat on the cool concrete for a moment, hoping the thing really was dead. A stray hair brushed against the bare skin of my knuckled, and stung as it began burrowing into my flesh.
  </p>
  <p>
  The air in the basement was cool and stagnant. Like the air of a cave, was miles underground. I stood up, using a box for leverage. With the bottom half of the broom, I shoved the dead thing further into the darkness of the basement. Better safe than sorry.</p>
  </p>
  <p>
  <p>  I waited a few minutes more to make sure the creature really was dead. I wasn’t the fan of horror movies my brother was, and I was done dealing with the awful thing. Weak light coming down from the floor above reflected off the tire iron. Once again, I felt a sense of enormity. Of being swallowed up by a endless underground space.
  </p>
  <p>
  The battery on my phone was fine, but I still wasn’t getting a signal. It was almost five. I’d been in the old farmhouse longer than I thought.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Fucking great,” I said. “I hope you’re happy, you shit."
  </p>
  <p>
  The thing didn’t respond. No mumbling. No mocking little impressions of my words.
  </p>
  <p>
  My chest heaved against the thick, stale air in the basement. The light was fading in the basement, and even the doorway leading outside seemed darker.
  </p>
  <p>
  I hopped closer to the exit and found a stack of wood behind a box. Leftover scraps from a home improvement project, back when someone thought this place was worth improving. My leg burned as I moved, but it didn’t seem too banged up from my fight with the thing.
  </p>
  <p>
  I tested my weight on a suitable piece of wood. I felt a jolt of fear when I leaned on the rough edge of the wooden trim, certain the thing would come again, mumbling and hungry out of the darkness. I waited, but nothing came.
  </p>
  <p>
  I leaned my new crutch inside the doorway and pulled on the doorknob as hard as I could. The white metal door didn’t budge.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Are you fucking kidding me,” I said. The heavy darkness at the rear of the basement swallowed my voice. For a second, I imagined myself walking into that darkness, never to return. The thought was comforting, and I found myself turning from the door. Toward the rear of the basement. I shook my head to clear it. There was still another way out.
  </p>
  <p>
  I moved slowly toward the collapsed floor. The feeling of being underwater intensified, and I imagined I saw shapes moving in the dim light. Misshapen creatures, like deep sea fish. My breath came more freely at the foot of the ramp, as if the air was less dense there. I put my left foot on the wooden floor and took a half step forward. The wood creaked, but the floor held. I told myself it must be sturdy enough, if it hadn’t yet broken all the way through.
  </p>
  <p>
  Still, it was a steep climb. I didn’t see another way out of the basement, and there was no chance I was exploring the darkness at the back of the basement. Not after that compulsion came over me while I stood in front of the door. I eased my right foot up on the edge of the collapsed floor.</p>
  </p>
  <p>
  When both my feet left the basement floor, I felt an intake of air behind me. A sensation of being in a wind tunnel came over me as a sound rose around me. It was the constant chuckling noise the creature made, but a thousand times louder. A mocking roar that filled the basement and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
  </p>
  <p>
  I turned around to find two enormous yellow orbs glaring at me from the darkness. A heat fell upon me, more glorious than the heat I felt from the creature’s gaze. That compulsion to submit, to walk into the darkness, came over me again. I dropped my crutch, and hobbled toward those awful, welcoming yellow eyes, eager and willing.
  </p>
  <p>
  My phone vibrated in my pocket, forgotten, as I walked into the sick heat waiting for me in the darkness.
