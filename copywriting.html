  <h1><small>Copywriting Samples</small></h1>
  <p>
    Here you'll find samples of my copywriting work. I've done a ton of conversion-focused writing for various media - from blog posts to banner ads, to social media to varations for a/b testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm especially interested in writing long-form copy that helps people. I love working on a long-form sales page addressing a specific pain point, writing blog posts that provide clear, easy to understand instructions on how to solve a particularly difficult problem.
  </p>

    I love working on technical products, and crafting copy designed to turn visitors into trialing users, and trialing users into happy, paying, long-term customers. I specialize in writing in-app messaging that gently guides a new signup along the funnel, and lifecycle emails that keep users happy, interested, and engaged with the product.

      A good blog post provides useful, valuable content for the target audience. The metric I use to gauge whether a blog post is successful is simple: did this post help people?

      I really love lifecycle messaging. I've worked on a ton of SaaS applications, and user onboarding is something I've always enjoyed. I love mapping out a user's journey, identifying good touch points to contact someone, and crafting timely messages designed to solve common problems.
