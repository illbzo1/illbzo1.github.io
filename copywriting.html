<h1><small>Good copy is copy that works.</small></h1>
<p>
  I write copy armed with research skills gained during my journalism school days, an interest in solving problems, and a lifelong love of writing.
</p>
<p>
  <!-- wordy and redundant, rewrite -->
  I've written tons of conversion-focused copy - everything from paid search advertisements to customer lifecycle messaging, from the first, best take on marketing copy for a new startup to value proposition variations destined for a/b testing. I'm a problem solver, and I like to do my homework before getting started. That means researching as much as possible, given a deadline. I like data, and I like measureable improvement.

  I have a few questions I like to answer before writing a single line of copy. What's the product? Who is the product for?  What problems do they have? More importantly, how do they talk about their problems? If I can answer these questions, I've got a great foundation for writing copy that works. I like to start by talking to people using the product or service. An audience will tell me how to write copy that resonates, and the better I understand the problem, the better the copy will work.

  I'm the biggest fan of writing long-form sales copy - especially marketing pages, landing pages, and email marketing copy. I like chewing on a big problem, but interesting projects come in all shapes and sizes. I love hammering out a value proposition, writing copy that compels someone to take a desired action, and converting passive visitors into active, engaged customers.
