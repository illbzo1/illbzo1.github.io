  <h1><small>Copywriting Samples</small></h1>
  <p>
    Here you'll find samples of my copywriting work. I've done a ton of conversion-focused writing for various media - from blog posts to banner ads, to social media to varations for a/b testing.

    I most enjoy writing long-form copy that helps people. I love working on a long-form sales page that speaks directly to someone's pain points, writing blog posts that help someone solve a problem, in-app messaging that gently guides a new signup along the funnel, and lifecycle emails that keep new users happy, interested, and engaged with the product.

      I've written copy for several advertising campaigns - from retargeting ads using services like AdRoll, to search display campaigns using Google Ads and Bing Ads, to email marketing platforms like Launchbit.

      A good blog post provides useful, valuable content for the target audience. The metric I use to gauge whether a blog post is successful is simple: did this post help people?

      I really love lifecycle messaging. I've worked on a ton of SaaS applications, and user onboarding is something I've always enjoyed. I love mapping out a user's journey, identifying good touch points to contact someone, and crafting timely messages designed to solve common problems.
