<h1><small>Good copy is copy that works.</small></h1>
<p>
  When I sit down to write copy, I come armed with research skills gained during my journalism school days, an interest in solving problems gained from helping customers succeed with SaaS applications, and a lifelong love of writing.
</p>
<p>
  I've written a ton of conversion-focused copy - everything from paid search advertisements to customer lifecycle messaging, from the first, best take on marketing copy for a new startup to value proposition variations destined for a/b testing. I'm a problem solver, and I like to do my homework before getting started. That means researching as much as possible, given a deadline. I like data, and I like measureable improvement.
</p>
<p>
  I have a few questions I like to answer before I write a single line of copy. What's the product? Who is the product for? What does the ideal customer care about? What problems do they have? More importantly, how do they talk about their problems? If I can answer these questions, I've got a great foundation for writing copy that works. I've found the best place to start is by talking to the people already using the product or service, or who have already purchased the good. An audience will tell me how to write copy that resonates, and the better I understand the problem, the better the copy will work.
</p>
<p>
  My favorite copy to write is long-form sales pages, but interesting projects come in all shapes and sizes. There's nothing I like better than hammering out a value proposition, writing copy that compels someone to take a desired action, and converting passive visitors into active, engaged customers.
