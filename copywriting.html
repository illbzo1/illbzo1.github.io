  <h1><small>Good copy is copy that works.</small></h1>
  <p>
    When I sit down to write copy, I bring a love of research gained during my journalism school days, an interest in solving problems gained from years of helping customers succeed with SaaS applications, and a lifelong love of writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've written a ton of conversion-focused copy - everything from blog posts to customer lifecycle messages, to Tweets, sales copy, and treatments for A/B testing. I've got a passion for working on technical products, and with small teams and businesses. I find true delight in researching a problem, crafting copy to address specific pain points, and converting passive visitors into active, engaged customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I especially love writing long form sales copy. It's impossible to write about a subject without knowing anything about that subject. What's the product? Who is the product for? What does the ideal customer care about, and what problems do they have? How do they talk about those problems?
  </p>
  <p>
    It often doesn't take much time to get a good handle on the kind of copy I should write. An hour of research is time well spent. An audience will tell me how to write copy that resonates, and the better I understand the problem, the better the copy will work.
