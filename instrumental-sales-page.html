    This project was a rewrite of Instrumental's home page. The owners of Instrumental decided to shift Instrumental's positioning to appeal to larger tech companies that needed high-scale, highly customizable application and server monitoring. Much of the copy was taken from a PPC campaign I ran on Bing Ads, and from talking to existing users of Instrumental about their own integrations, and how they used the product on a daily basis.

    I worked closely with the designer and marketing director, drawing upon real world implementations of Instrumental to clearly communicate the value of a customized application monitoring solution to an audience that is largely used to less customizable monitoring tools.
