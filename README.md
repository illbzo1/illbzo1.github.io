This site uses Jekyll for serving pages and Foundation for CSS.

Helpful links:

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

Running the site locally:

    jekyll serve

Dumb way to preview content before publication:

  Edit head.html, swap in localhost:4000 for tylermoore.website. Yes, I know. This is really stupid but it works for now.

To do:

* Index
  - clean up styles (headers, sidebar, etc)
  - add a logo to link to in the nav bar

* Blog
  - add categories to blog index
  - redo blog styles (search by tag, category, etc)
  - add comments to blog posts

* Contact
  - "Contact" should link to a real contact page, not simply be a mailto

* Writing
  - should be a portfolio style page, with samples of writing
  - should likely be separated, at least into "Fiction" and "Copywriting"
