This site uses Jekyll for serving pages and Foundation for CSS.

Helpful links:

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

Running the site locally:

    jekyll serve

To do:

* smarter templating (IE we probably don't need a separate layout for each static page)
* redo index (short update posts out, now that the site is pretty established)
* add comments to blog
* redo blog styles (search by tag, category, etc)
