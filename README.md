## To do:

### General
  * need to add and update robots.txt
  * Ensure there's no dumb mistakes in the actual markup
    - review generated code in a browser
    - see if we can simplify the code
  * Look for more opportunities for partialization
    - can we simplify layout?
  * What about a Jekyll theme?
    - http://jekyllthemes.org/
  * Read through SEO for Jekyll
    - rel author (is this still a thing?)
    - good resource: http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/21/SEO-for-your-Jekyll-blog/

### Blog
  * style sidebar
    - look at rough screenshot for an idea
    - all links should be styled like other links in the site
  * look into full height sidebar
  * need more content for sidebar
    - rss feed that works
    - short bio / info about the blog
    - other?
  * most recently updated category should be displayed differently via CSS (bold text, etc)
  * add comments to blog posts
  * Add social sharing buttons per post
    - http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/20/add-social-sharing-buttons-with-jekyll/
  * Last blog in the list should not have an HR after (looks dumb with the footer)
  * quotes should have a distinct style
  * make meta descriptions for blog posts more descriptive - about the book and what I got from it, not what I did

### Contact

### Copywriting
  * Open all links in new window

### Header
  * Should perhaps be combined with the nav

### Footer
  * Needs to float to the bottom on pages with very little content

### Index
  * fix default layout. we have duplicate, unnecessary rows.
  * clean up styles (headers, sidebar, etc)
  * add a logo to link to in the nav bar

### Writing
  * should be a portfolio style page, with samples of writing
  * should be exclusively for fiction work
