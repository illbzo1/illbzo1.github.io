## To do:

### General
  * Fix header styles
    - should be consistent throughout the blog, index, etc.
  * Ensure there's no dumb mistakes in the actual markup
    - review generated code in a browser
    - see if we can simplify the code
  * Look for more opportunities for partialization
    - can we simplify layout?
  * What about a Jekyll theme?
    - http://jekyllthemes.org/
  * Read through SEO for Jekyll
    - rel author (is this still a thing?)
    - good resource: http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/21/SEO-for-your-Jekyll-blog/

### Contact
  * Update styling of page
    - should be consistent with the rest of the site
  * Update copy on page
    - should be more compelling and provide a clear benefit for contacting me
  * Form should use Ajax to submit
    - I don't want to send visitors to Formspree
    - I want greater control over flash messages, confirmation, redirection after submission, etc.

### Index
  * clean up styles (headers, sidebar, etc)
  * add a logo to link to in the nav bar

### Blog
  * add categories to blog index
  * add categories / tags to blog posts
    - should be visible and searchable in the blog sidebar
  * most recently updated category should be displayed differently via CSS (bold text, etc)
  * add comments to blog posts
  * Make sure RSS link actually works
  * Add social sharing buttons per post

### Contact
  * "Contact" should link to a real contact page, not simply be a mailto

### Writing
  * should be a portfolio style page, with samples of writing
  * should likely be separated, at least into "Fiction" and "Copywriting"
