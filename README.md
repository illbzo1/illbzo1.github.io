This site uses Jekyll for serving pages and Foundation for CSS.

## Helpful links:

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

## Running the site locally:

    jekyll serve

## To do:

### General
  * site needs a meta description
    - go through SEO for Jekyll
    - need to get the site indexed, doesn't appear in Google searches
    - need to add and update robots.txt
  * Clean up site.css
    - getting a bit untidy
    - have likely introduced bad / inconsistent styling all over
  * Fix hover state styles for all actions
    - any links in the nav
    - any link in the site
    - submit button on the contact form
  * Ensure there's no dumb mistakes in the actual markup
    - review generated code in a browser
    - see if we can simplify the code
  * Look for more opportunities for partialization
    - can we simplify layout?
  * What about a Jekyll theme?
    - http://jekyllthemes.org/
  * Read through SEO for Jekyll
    - rel author (is this still a thing?)

### Blog
  * Full post view needs to have the same header styling as the rest of the site
  * add categories to blog index
  * add categories / tags to blog posts
    - should be visible and searchable in the blog sidebar
  * most recently updated category should be displayed differently via CSS (bold text, etc)
  * add comments to blog posts
  * Make sure RSS link actually works
  * Add social sharing buttons per post
    - http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/20/add-social-sharing-buttons-with-jekyll/
  * Last blog in the list should not have an HR after (looks dumb with the footer)
  * quotes should have a distinct style
  * blog posts most likely need meta descriptions

### Contact
  * remove text link to Twitter

### Copywriting
  * Final check
    - double check any supporting copy for errors and wordiness
  * Open all links in new window

### Header
  * Should perhaps be combined with the nav

### Footer
  * Could use better styling
    - twitter should not turn brown on hover, this is gross
  * Needs to float to the bottom on pages with very little content

### Index
  * fix default layout. we have duplicate, unnecessary rows.
  * clean up styles (headers, sidebar, etc)
  * add a logo to link to in the nav bar
  * remove age from "About Me" section
  * remove "About this site"

### Writing
  * should be a portfolio style page, with samples of writing
  * should likely be separated, at least into "Fiction" and "Copywriting"
