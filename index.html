      <h1>My name is Tyler Moore.</h1>
      <p>
        I have a hard time with autobiographies. But lists are easy. I understand lists. I work well with a list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mid-thirties, Indianapolis, enthusiastic, a friend to cats, a fan of IPAs, a hugger, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher.
        <br />
        But most importantly:
      </p>
      <h2>I'm a writer</h2>
      <p>
        I've been writing since I was 8 years old. That nasty old saying "Writers like having written" is bullshit, as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
      	I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, early in the morning or late at night, drinking black coffee or cold water, chewing through a story.
      </p>
      <p>
     	Writing is my Work. All caps, as a sign of respect. It demands respect, because it's dangerous, and it's fragile. Some days the Work is like putting a machine together. Some days it's like there's something alive in my gut, and it'll burn me alive if I don't get it out. Some days the Work is just work - it's boring, and it's flat, and it has to be done. But I love it, every second, every moment.

        About this site
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is my personal site. I've had a few over the years - this is the latest thing. It's a place for me to mess around with CSS, and keep a super minimal blog about what I'm reading, what I'm writing, and anything that comes up along the way, and in between.
