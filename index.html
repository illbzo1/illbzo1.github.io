  <h1><small>My name is Tyler, and I'm a writer.</small></h1>
  <p>
    I've been writing since I was 8 years old. I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, early in the morning or late at night, drinking black coffee, chewing through a story. I write every morning for about an hour - mostly fiction, and mostly horror. It's a good way to start the day, but more importantly, it's a good way to live.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a copywriter and copy editor living in Indianapolis. On any given day, you'll find me working with a designer on in-app messaging to improve user onboarding, split testing copy for a cold contact email marketing campaign, or writing sales copy to convert visitors into buyers. Every day, I'm writing, editing, tweaking, and improving copy of all kinds to help businesses succeed. I love solving problems, and a big part of problem solving is communication.

  <h2><small>About me</small></h2>
  <p>
    Enthusiastic, a hugger, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs. I graduated from Indiana University with a B.A. in Journalism in 2006. Since graduation, I haven't done any journalizing, but I <em>have</em> written a ton. Not enough, though. Never enough!
