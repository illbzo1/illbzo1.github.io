      <p>
        I've been writing since I was 8 years old. That old saying "Writers like having written" is bullshit, as far as I'm concerned. I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, early in the morning or late at night, drinking black coffee, chewing through a story.

      <p>
        Writing is my Work. All caps, as a sign of respect. It demands respect, because it's dangerous, and it's fragile. Some days I sit down to write and I'm putting a machine together - every time I reach for the next piece, I find it, ready and waiting, fitting in neatly, exactly where I wanted it to go. Some days it's like there's something alive in my gut, and it'll burn me alive if I don't get it out. Some days the Work is just work - it's boring, and it's flat, but it has to be done. But I love it, every second, every moment.

      <h2><small>About this site</small></h2>
      <p>
        This is mostly a place where I talk about writing. I plan to actually *publish* some of my writing here, eventually. For now, I'm keeping a blog where I talk about books I've been reading, and what I've learned from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also a place for me to mess around with CSS, and serves as a record for where I've been, where I want to go, and anything that comes up along the way.
