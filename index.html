  <h1><small>Hi! My name is Tyler, and I'm a writer.</small></h1>
  <p>
    I've been writing since I was 8 years old. I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, early in the morning or late at night, drinking black coffee, chewing through a story. I write every morning  for about an hour - mostly fiction, and mostly horror. It's a good way to start the day, but more importantly, it's a good way to live.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a copywriter and copy editor in Indianapolis. I get a huge kick out of solving problems, especially when I get to use words to do it. On any given day, you'll find me working with a designer on in-app messaging to improve user onboarding for a technical product, or working on customer lifecycle emails, or writing and editing blog posts to drive organic traffic and convert visitors into buyers. Every day, I'm writing copy of all kinds to help businesses succeed.

  <h2><small>About me</small></h2>
  <p>
    Indianapolis, enthusiastic, a hugger, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs. I graduated from Indiana University with a B.A. in Journalism in 2006. Since graduation, I haven't done any journalizing, but I <em>have</em> written a ton. Not enough, though. Never enough! Write more!
