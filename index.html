    <h1><small>Hi! My name is Tyler, and I'm a writer.</small></h1>
    <p>
      I've been writing since I was 8 years old. I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, early in the morning or late at night, drinking black coffee, chewing through a story. I write every morning  for about an hour - mostly fiction, and mostly horror. It's a good way to start the day, but more importantly, it's a good way to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing is my Work. All caps, as a sign of respect. It demands respect, because it's dangerous, and it's fragile. Some days I sit down to write and I'm putting a machine together - every time I reach for the next piece, I find it, ready and waiting, fitting in neatly, exactly where I wanted it to go. Some days it's like there's something alive in my gut, and it'll burn me alive if I don't get it out. Some days the Work is just work - it's boring, and it's flat, but it has to be done. But I love it, every second, every moment.

    <h2><small>About me</small></h2>
    <p>
      Mid-thirties, Indianapolis, enthusiastic, a friend to cats, a fan of IPAs, a hugger, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher. I graduated from Indiana University with a B.A. in Journalism in 2006. Since then, I haven't done any journalizing, but I <em>have</em> written a ton. I'm a copywriter, copy editor, and I work for a successful software development company in Indianapolis.

    <h2><small>About this site</small></h2>
    <p>
      This is mostly a place where I talk about writing. I plan to <em>publish</em> some of my fiction writing here, and show off copy I've written. Eventually! For now, I'm keeping a blog where I write about what I've learned about writing from the books I've read, and my own thoughts on writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is also a place for me to mess around with CSS, and it's a record of where I've been, where I want to go, and anything that comes up along the way.
