    Everything is a draft. Everything is a work in progress. Nothing has to be perfect, but it has to be finished. And once something is finished, it can be improved.

    Hi! I'm Tyler Moore, and I'm a marketer and writer living in Indianapolis. I've never been intimidated by a blank page, or a huge pile of work that lies in front of me. I'm good at getting started, and I like building things.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spend a lot of my time writing, reading, and learning. I like making things better. Done is better than perfect, and the worst finished book is better by far than the most beautiful novel yet to be written.
  </p>

    I always have too much to read (my GoodReads account is up to 334 books to read) and I like making people laugh. I'm a natural problem solver, a known planner, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs.
