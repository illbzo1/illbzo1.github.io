    Hi! I'm Tyler, and I'm a fiction writer from Indianapolis. I've been a fan of short, weird fiction since I learned to read. While most of what I write can be called horror, I like the phrase "weird fiction" - it gives me more room to operate, and I don't feel as confined by the typical constraints of a horror story. I like monsters, but I like monsters with a <em>purpose.</em>

    In my spare time, I read a lot, play a ton of video games, and mess around with web development. I'm an easy grinner, a high-fiver, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, a fan of IPAs, and I love making people laugh.
