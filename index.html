    This headline is the clearest, most honest distillation of how I work I can imagine. Everything is a draft. Everything is a work in progress. Nothing has to be perfect, but it has to be finished. And once something is finished, it can be improved.

    Hi! I'm Tyler Moore, and I'm a writer and marketing strategist. I'm someone who likes doing things. I like starting new projects, and I like building things. I've never been one to be intimidated by a blank page, or a huge pile of work that lies in front of me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I write a lot, and I read a lot. I think about how things work, and I think about how things can be improved. I'm a firm believer that done is better than perfect, and the worst finished book is better by far than the most beautiful novel yet to be written.

    I'm a known planner. I am aware there are writers who write without an outline. I am aware there are marketers who run marketing experiments without proper metrics in place, or without setting a measureable goal ahead of time. I know these people exist, but I can't understand how. It's like trying to imagine what the color purple sounds like.

    I always have too much to read (my GoodReads account is up to 334 books to read) and I like making people laugh. I'm a natural problem solver, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs.
