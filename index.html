  <h1><small>My name is Tyler, and I'm a writer.</small></h1>
  <p>
    I'm a writer and marketer living in Indianapolis. I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, drinking black coffee, and chewing through a story. I start every day by writing for an hour, and I never feel fully awake until I've written something.
  </p>
  <p>
    Years of experience working on technical products has instilled a deep love of marketing strategy, optimization, and provable results. I'm interested in all aspects of marketing strategy, from market research to campaign implementation to user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been writing since I was 8 years old, and luckily enough, marketing is a great outlet for writing.

  <h2><small>About me</small></h2>
  <p>
    I like to laugh, and I like to make other people laugh. I'm a problem solver, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from Indiana University with a B.A. in Journalism in 2006. I haven't done any journalizing in my professional life, but I <em>have</em> written a ton. Not enough, though. Never enough!
