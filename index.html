            Decided I needed some red in my life after all.

          <h3>Small style tweaks, partializing navigation bar</h3>
          <p>
            Should probably just partialize everything at this point. Stole a color scheme from the internet (KISS IT GOODBYE INTERNET) and tweaked styling a bit. Going for more of a dark gray than a pure black, and a nice orange instead of a blood red. Red I love you, you know I do, but GODDAMN you're hard to look at sometimes.

          <h3>Using Fontawesome, getting a nav bar shoved in there</h3>
          <p>
          	Yeah but what if I used like all the things for this site? Got a nav bar going, links to the social media profiles I actually use (should maybe just be Twitter, but whatevs) and an email link. Side note: big, big fan of Foundation so far. It's made laying out this site ridiculously easy.

          <h3>Adding Jekyll, working on templates</h3>
          <p>
          	Installed Jekyll to serve pages. Was a bit leery at first, due to past trouble with Jekyll, but I'll need something for a blog. Templating will make managing the handful of static pages on this site easier. Didn't take too long to get it up and running and doing my bidding: maybe an hour, most of which was spent reading documentation. I'm kind of "into" this shitty progress log I'm doing here. You want timestamps? haha eat shit, nerd

          <h3>This shit is looking fly as hell son</h3>
          <p>
          	Fuck yeah, got that bomb ass header installed now. I hope you've taken note of how magnificent this site is looking. It's like Mighty Zeus himself reached down and said "I can't believe you made such an impression on the world without even bothering to present yourself in the form of a bull or a swan, Tyler."

          <h3>Man I hope you're ready for this shit</h3>
          <p>
          	When I say "this shit" I mean basic ass text on a page, the most default of Foundation stylings, and no real content to speak of.
          </p>
          <p>
          	I'll probably update this a lot, throughout the weekend. I might lose my goddamn mind and install Jekyll. haha, whaaaaaat?
