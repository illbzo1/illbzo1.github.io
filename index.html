	Hi! I'm Tyler, and I'm a full stack marketer. What does that mean? On one hand, it means I'm a generalist. On the other, it means I'm not tied to specific tools or practices. I take an adaptable, data-driven, and creative approach to growth and marketing. I work with businesses of all sizes to identify their pain points, come up with and implement possible solutions, and finally, measure the impact of the work I've done.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I'm highly curious, and a natural problem solver. I use both of these traits to help businesses improve their marketing. From customer development to funnel optimization to marketing automation - no two businesses will have the exact same problems, and a single tool set won't work in every case.
  <p>
	I'm also a fiction writer. I've been a fan of short, weird fiction since I could read. It's not much of a leap to go from "reader" to "writer", and I recently started writing my own short, weird fiction. I write mostly horror and speculative fiction, with some soft sci-fi thrown in for kicks.
  <p>
	I read a lot, play a ton of video games, and I like making people laugh. I'm an easy grinner, a high-fiver, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs.
