  <p>
    I'm a writer, copywriter, and marketer living in Indianapolis. I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, early in the morning or late at night, drinking black coffee, chewing through a story. I start off every day by writing for an hour - mostly fiction, and mostly horror. It's a good way to start the day, and it's a good way to live.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like working on technical products, with small teams, and on projects that can be closely monitored and measured for improvement. I love using data to write and improve copy, with a special interest in customer onboarding, long-form sales copy, and advertising. On any given day, you'll find me writing in-app messages to improve user onboarding, split testing copy for an email marketing campaign, or writing sales pages to convert visitors into buyers. Every day, I'm writing, editing, and improving copy to help businesses succeed.

  <h2><small>About me</small></h2>
  <p>
    I like to laugh, and I like to make other people laugh, too. I'm a problem solver, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs.
</p>
<p>
    I graduated from Indiana University with a B.A. in Journalism in 2006. I haven't done any journalizing in my professional life, but I <em>have</em> written a ton. Not enough, though. Never enough!
