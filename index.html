	Hi! I'm Tyler, and I'm a full stack marketer. I'm experienced with a wide range of marketing concepts and tactics - everything from customer development to email marketing, to funnel optimization to marketing automation. I work with businesses of all sizes to identify their pain points, implement possible solutions, and measure the impact of the work I've done.

  	I'm highly curious, and a natural problem solver. No two businesses will face the exact same challenges, and a single tool set won't work in every case. Lately, I've gotten super excited about growth hacking, marketing automation, and mobile app marketing. The intersection of technology and marketing is a fascinating place!
  <p>
	But that's not all - I'm also a fiction writer. I've been a fan of short, weird fiction since I learned to read. It's not much of a leap from "reader" to "writer", and I recently started writing my own short, weird fiction. I write mostly horror and speculative fiction, with some soft sci-fi thrown in for kicks.
  <p>
	In my spare time, I read a lot, play a ton of video games, and mess around with web development. I'm an easy grinner, a high-fiver, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, a fan of IPAs, and I love making people laugh.
