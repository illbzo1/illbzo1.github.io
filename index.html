    Hi! I'm Tyler Moore, and I'm a marketer and writer living in Indianapolis. I'm a big fan of experimentation, optimization, and growth. I like building things, and I'm good at getting started.

    I always have too much to read (my GoodReads account is up to 334 books to read) and I like making people laugh. I'm a natural problem solver, a known planner, a high-fiver, an easy grinner, a loud laugher, a friend to cats, and a fan of IPAs.
