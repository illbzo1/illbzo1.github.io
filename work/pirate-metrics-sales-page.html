    I wanted to be a bit more playful with the copy for Pirate Metrics. The name itself references Dave McClure's "Startup Metrics for Pirates", and I thought slightly irreverant yet informative copy would play well with the target audience - subscription-based startup companies. Plus it was a lot of fun to write.

    I started by talking to startups in the area, and reading about startups online. I discovered startups wanted to understand their current user base, keep their current customers happy, and find more customers. I took a revenue-heavy approach with the copy for this product. Pirate Metrics is a tool for startups, and startups need more runway. Always more runway.
