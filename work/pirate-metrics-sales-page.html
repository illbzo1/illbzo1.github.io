    This was a refresh of the original sales copy for Pirate Metrics, a startup designed to provide user-specific analytics for SaaS companies. The name itself references Dave McClure's "Startup Metrics for Pirates", and I thought slightly irreverant yet informative copy would play well with the target audience - subscription-based startup companies.

    I gathered data by talking to people running startups, and reading about startups online. I discovered startups wanted to understand their current user base, keep their current customers happy, and find more customers. I took a revenue-heavy approach with the copy for this product. Pirate Metrics was a tool for startups, and startups always need more runway.
