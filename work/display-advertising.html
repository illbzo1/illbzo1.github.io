  <h1><small id="small-header">Display Advertising</small></h1>
  <p>
    I'm a big fan of retargeting and PPC networks. I write lots of long form copy, and shorter copy can be a nice change of pace. Especially since I get easy access to sweet, sweet data. I'm into data-driven marketing and continual improvement, and I've created, managed, and optimized several display ad campaigns. I like email marketing as well, and I've enjoyed running several blast email campaigns as well as long term customer lifecycle messaging.

  <h2><small id="small-header">DocRaptor Retargeting Campaign</small></h2>

  </p>
  <p>
    These are creatives from a retargeting campaign for DocRaptor. I wrote copy based on the features DocRaptor customers care about most - ease of use, quality of output, and reliable infrastructure.

    These are ads from an automated email marketing campaign for Instrumental. I wrote the copy with Instrumental's value proposition in mind - a highly configurable, customized approach to application monitoring, designed to provide deeper levels of insight than similar products on the market.
