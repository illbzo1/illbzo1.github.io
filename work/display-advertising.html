  <h1><small id="small-header">Display Advertising</small></h1>
  <p>
    I'm a big fan of retargeting and search engine marketing. I love data-driven marketing and continual improvement, and ad campaigns have proven to be a great place to test, measure, and improve a marketing message.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've created, managed, and optimized several display ad campaigns. I've also implemented several blast email campaigns, as well as long term customer lifecycle messaging.

  <h2><small id="small-header">DocRaptor Retargeting Campaign</small></h2>
  <p>
    These are creatives from a remarketing campaign for DocRaptor. I wrote copy based on the features DocRaptor customers cared about most - ease of use, quality of output, and reliable infrastructure.
