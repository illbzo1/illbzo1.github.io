    This project was a complete overhaul of Proteus' website, as the company repositioned from focusing on document review to providing complete information governance consulting. Proteus is a team of experienced legal professionals who are concerned with educating their audience on the importance of sound information governance protocols. They deliver a thoroughly defensible information governance, ediscovery, and document review service, and their website needed to express the full range of the services they company provides.

    I worked closely with founding members of Proteus, to craft their new messaging strategy, map out required elements (including content, site design, and an appropriate platform) before implementing Proteus' new site design.
