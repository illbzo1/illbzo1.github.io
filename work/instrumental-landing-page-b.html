    This is a second treatment of a landing page for a PPC campaign for Instrumental. As part of a bigger overhaul in Instrumental's marketing, I wanted to determine what sort of copy converted. With this take, I focused on questions Instrumental could answer based on a user's application data.

    This copy talks about the problems a potential user will run into while operating an application. The goal was to convince visitors a customized monitoring solution was a better fit for their application, using real life examples to show how Instrumental works.
