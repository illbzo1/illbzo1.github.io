     copywriting, keyword research
  </p>
  <p>
    This is one half of an a/b test for Instrumental. I wrote copy for two landing pages, ran PPC ads on the Bing Network targeting search terms related to <em>application monitoring</em>, and did a ton of research prior to a big repositioning for the product.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked with the designer to create two landing page variations for the application monitoring campaign. The goal of this campaign was not only to determine whether application monitoring itself was a good search term to target, but to nail the right tone and style of copy for the target audience.
