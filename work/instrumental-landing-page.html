    This is the first treatment for an A/B test for Instrumental. I wrote copy for two landing pages, ran PPC ads on the Bing Ads Network targeting search terms related to "application monitoring".
  </p>
  <p>
    For this campaign, I chose Bing Ads over Google Ads because I wanted to reach developers using DuckDuckGo as their search engine. My hypothesis was that using Bing Ads would result in higher quality leads at a lower price per click than using Google Ads, but with a smaller reach, due to lower market penetration of DuckDuckGo compared to Google.

    I worked with the designer to create two landing page variations for the application monitoring campaign. The goal of this campaign was not only to determine whether application monitoring itself was a good search term to target, but to nail the right tone and style of copy for the target audience.
