    This project was a second take on sales copy for Codifferous. The original version was converting well, but people who signed up weren't reviewing code. I wanted to know why, so I spent a week talking to 40 developers about code review. Then I rewrote the copy to position Codifferous as a solution for the biggest problems developers had - code review takes too much time, and it's difficult to review code after a pull request has closed.

    The revised copy saw a large improvement in conversion and adoption rates, as well as long-term improvement in organic results for search terms related to code review.
