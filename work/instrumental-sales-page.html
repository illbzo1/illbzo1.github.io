    This project was a rewrite of Instrumental's marketing page. Instrumental was repositioned from a tool for startup businesses to a complete monitoring solution for high scale technology companies that absolutely <em>have</em> to know how their entire technology stack is performing in real time. Talk about a big change! A lot of the ideas for the copy were inspired by Instrumental's existing customers, based on actual use cases, and ad copy that converted.
