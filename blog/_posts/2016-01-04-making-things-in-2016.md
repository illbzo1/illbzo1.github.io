desc: Inspired by Justin Jackson's 2016 Maker Challenge, here's a list of things I want to make this year.
---
I ran across Justin Jackson's [2016 Maker Challenge](http://megamaker.co/challenge/) a while back, and it sounded like a lot of fun. At any rate, it sounded like a good excuse to work on some projects I've been thinking about for a while.

Here's a list of things I want to make, build, create, or otherwise bring to life.

This list starts off specific, and slowly heads into more nebulous territory. There are some real dragons around number 5 or 6, and this list only gets MORE NEBULOUS from there.

#### 1) Write 10 New Short Stories

While this is TECHNICALLY 10 things, I'm counting it as one. This is an easy one for me - I wrote 12 short stories in 2015.

Those stories were mostly just first drafts, though, and that's A Problem. I have final edits of 2 out of 12 stories I wrote in 2015. This year, I'm focusing on polishing and editing stories I've written. So when I say "Write 10 Short Stories" what I mean is "Write and Rewrite and Rewrite and Rewrite 10 Short Stories Until You Feel Like Another Human Being Could Read Them."

#### 2) Build A Web App

I'm a huge fan of [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) for editing, but it doesn't do a few things I'd like. I've had an idea for a similar tool for a while, and I've already started working on it.

This app idea is a big part of why I want to get better at JavaScript, by the way.

#### 3) Make A Game

This is mostly an excuse for me to play around with Unity and/or learn how iOS programming works. As you may know, I'm a big, big fan of video games. Maybe one of the biggest. I've always wanted to make a game, and this seems like a good year to finally do it.

#### 4) Construct Raised Garden Beds

Miss Lady is an avid gardener, and we've got some store bought raised garden beds in our side yard. They're pretty good, and produced a ton of delicious yellow tomatoes this past summer, but we've already started talking about expanding.

One of our neighbors has some really great looking raised beds, and I'd like to try my hand at building some myself. As a (relatively new) homeowner, I'm very interested in the idea of improving our home myself. No joke - I bought some foam insulators for all of our outlets on Amazon last night, and I am super excited to receive and install them.

I like these ideas, and would like to use them as inspirato:

#### 5) Record and Publish A Podcast

Fun fact: I used to do a podcast with some friends, back in 2008 - 2010. It was called [Dream Spoofers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dream-spoofers/id300167858?mt=2), and the idea was that one of us would have a dream, tell the others about it, and then we'd interpret that dream.

The working idea I have is called Tyler Cusses at Games. I often narrate what's happening when I play video games. It's something I've always done, as far as I know, and I think it'd be funny to record what I say, and then edit it together later. Maybe with an introduction, like "This week, I'm replaying Super Metroid. Here's what I thought about it," followed by a few choice comments like "Hell yeah, Super Missles!" or "Ugh stop draining my energies, nerd."

#### 6) Make A Twitter Bot

Remember when I said shit would get nebulous? I don't have a great idea for what kind of Twitter bot I want to make. Just that I want to make one. I've wanted to make one ever since I tweeted about Robocop once and got this incredible response:

![I'd Buy That For a Dollar](/img/for_a_dollar.jpg "I'd Buy That For a Dollar")

I loved this Twitter Bot, by the way. He hit me up a couple times because sometimes [I need to talk about Robocop](https://twitter.com/search?q=Robocop%20from%3Aillbzo1&src=typd&lang=en).

(I've since discovered that [Twitter Bot has been retired](http://muffinlabs.com/2014/01/01/requiem-for-a-twitter-bot/). Good write up!)

#### 7) Draw Comics

I drew a lot when I was a kid. Mostly it was undersea photos full of jelly fish and sharks, or drawings of dinosaurs that lived inside of volcanoes. But I had a couple of regular comics I drew for a while, in fourth grade. One was called "Ninja Guy and Judo," and it was basically about a ninja who went on adventures in space.

I had another one about a snake and a vulture who were buddies, but I don't remember what it was called.

It's something I miss doing, so what if I drew more comics? They don't have to be good. In fact, maybe they *shouldn't* be good!

#### 8) Record and Publish A Song or an Album

I don't have any musical talent. It's something I've long accepted and come to terms with, but I still have a desire to make music. I used to mess around in Garage Band, and I made a couple of tracks using sampled sound effects layered together.

I still think the idea has some merit, and it was fun, so I'm planning on making at least one song (maybe an EP) and releasing it this year.

#### 9) Build An Internet of Things Device

We're squarely off the map here. I don't really even know what I mean by "An Internet of Things Device," other than I'm recently pretty interested in hardware hacking thanks to some friends. My biggest idea is a real life version of these shoes, from one of my favorite [Achewood](http://www.achewood.com) strips:

![Here Comes a Special Boy](/img/here_comes_a_special_boy.gif "Here Comes a Special Boy")

Maybe this is what I should build. I already have some idea of how it would be done, and it's the kind of stupid but funny project I find appealing.

So there's a working list of what I want to make in 2016. What about you? What do you want to make this year?
