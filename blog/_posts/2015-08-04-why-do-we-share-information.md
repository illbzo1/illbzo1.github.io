desc: "Why do we share the information we choose to share? What makes something so remarkable we simply can't keep it to ourselves?"

I recently finished <em>Contagious</em> by Jonah Berger. It’s a fascinating look at why we spread certain types of information, how to identify the factors that makes information worth sharing, and how to apply those factors to marketing.

We spread information we find useful, or remarkable, or valuable, or that makes us look better to the audience. We spread ideas in the hope the information will help others, or improve our own situation.

And we're careful about who we share information with.

<blockquote>
  We don’t share a news story or recommendation with everyone we know. Rather, we tend to select particular people who we think would find that given piece of information most relevant.
</blockquote>

My friends would never recommend a new bourbon to me, but they do send me cool Lego stuff they find online, or weird cartoon strips, or recommendations for cyberpunk novels. If someone knows me, even a little, they usually have a good handle on what I’m into.

And I return the favor. We all do. I know exactly which members of my social circle will enjoy a comic, or a book, or a movie, or a video game. We like things that are remarkable, and things that remind us of the people we care about.

<blockquote>
  The best thing about remarkability, though, is that it can be applied to anything.
</blockquote>

We want to talk about interesting things. We want to spread information we find remarkable. But remarkability isn’t an end to itself. You want people to remember your message, but the vehicle and the message have to be connected. Take the Panda commercials, for example:

Or the old Unpimp the Auto Volkswagen commercials:

Both remarkable ad campaigns. Both surprising, emotional, and fantastic for social currency. It doesn’t hurt that both of these are readily available on YouTube, and are fun to share with a friend. But these aren’t just funny commercials. They’re successful marketing campaigns because they married the message with the vehicle that delivered it.

A funny commercial on YouTube is a great way to make your product more visible. I don't drive a Volkswagen, and I've never eaten Panda cheese, but I'm aware of both of these brands. I've told friends about these commercials before.

<blockquote>
  Making something more observable makes it easier to imitate. Thus a key factor in driving products to catch on is <em>public visibility</em>. If something is built to show, it’s built to grow.
</blockquote>

This is why you see logos on everything. It’s why Apple includes little stickers of its logo with new laptops. It's why we're willing to pay a premium for the right kind of shoes, and the right kind of car.

It’s why you see clever shopping bags like these:

They're remarkable. They're interesting, and they turn something retail shops require (a bag for customers to carry away purchases) into a walking advertisement for their brand. Something for people to notice and talk about.
