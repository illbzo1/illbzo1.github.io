So far this year, I've written rough drafts for two short stories and I'm most of the way through a third. I write 500 words a day, first thing in the morning, before I do anything else. I do 1,000 words on the weekends, or when I have a day off work. It's hard to calculate just how far I am into this third story. I've discovered something interesting about writing fiction - it doesn't always go according to plan.

I've scoffed at people who write without an outline (and I still do, it's MADNESS) but I've been surprised more than once at events that unfold while I'm writing. A character will make a surprise trip to a butcher's shop, and it makes sense. It fits, and it feels natural, even though I didn't plan it in my outline before sitting down to write.

Suddenly those hilarious gems from [@nanowrimo_txt](https://twitter.com/nanowrimo_txt) make more sense.

I wrote the first story using textedit, using folders and a ton of text files. This was not ideal, and I knew it, but it's how I did it. I switched to Evernote for the second, on the recommendation of my friend [Miles](http://mileszs.com/). I fully planned to try either [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) or [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) for the third.

*"Sure,"* I thought. *"Evernote works fine. Better than a folder full of disorganized text files. But I'll give one of the other apps a shot on the next story."*

Scrivener was too bloated for my taste. If I have to go through a 400-step tutorial to use writing software, I am not using that writing software.

Ulysses is more light weight than Scrivener, but I found it comparable to Evernote, so there wasn't a compelling reason to switch.

So I didn't switch. I'm still using Evernote. It's got the feature set I want: easy to organize stories and groups of stories, cloud sync, accessible from any device.

**What I Read**

I spoke a bit about my writing system in my last post, but I haven't mentioned my reading system. I'm reading three books per month: one book on writing, one book on copywriting, and one book on marketing.

Here's what I read in January:

*On Writing* by [Stephen King](http://stephenking.com/)

On Writing was a singular joy to read, and I wish I'd read it a decade ago. Stephen King is the reason I grew up wanting to be a writer. This book was the perfect combination of memoir and practical writing advice from a master of the genre.

Bonus: tons of interesting insights into horror stories I read in high school, how he wrote them, where he was when he wrote them, and the impact they had on his family's lives.

*Ogilvy on Advertising* by [David Ogilvy](http://www.ogilvy.com/About/Our-History/David-Ogilvy-Bio.aspx)

8Ogilvy on Advertising* and *The Copywriter's Handbook* were less enjoyable to read, but full of practical information. I was surprised to find *Ogilvy on Advertising* felt less dated than *The Copywriter's Handbook*, likely because Ogilvy focused less on specifics than Bly did. Ogilvy's relentless focus on provable, measurable results is fascinating. He was talking about data-driven marketing (a common enough practice in 2015) way back in the mid-1980s.

*The Copywriter's Handbook* by [Bob Bly](http://bly.com/new/index.html)

The copy of *The Copywriter's Handbook* I read had a new section on writing for the web that was hilariously dated in 2015. Tons of mentions of "e-zines". But the strategies Bly wrote about in 2005 still apply today - collecting emails, running drip campaigns, and selling with benefits. He had similar advice as Ogilvy: work on something you can measure. Try new approaches, measure the results, get better over time. Solid, practical advice for any marketer.

A common thread I noticed in all three of these books is each writer takes a practical, craftsman-like approach to writing. These aren't flowery authors. They write about the "craft" of writing, not the "art", which appeals to me.

**Thoughts on My Systems**

One month in and I'm feeling good about these systems. I've gotten a lot more done in a single month than I typically do. That persistent, nagging feeling I should be using my spare time more productively has all but vanished.

I've already thought of ways to improve my systems - bumping up my daily word count, and keeping notes on the book I'm reading as I read it. This would help with summary blog posts at the end of the month. I'd be able to talk about a book I read three weeks ago with more salient points than "It was good, I liked it".

Still, off to a good start. Feels good to talk about things I've done, not things I plan to do. I feel less pressure to keep a promise I've made.
