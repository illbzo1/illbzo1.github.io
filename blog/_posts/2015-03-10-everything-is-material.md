I've been reading Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott, and this quote rang true enough I had to jump up and write about it.

<blockquote>"So much of writing is about sitting down and doing it every day, and so much of it is about getting into the custom of taking in everything that comes along, seeing it all as grist for the mill."</blockquote>

Everything is material. Every person I know, every song I've ever heard, the linoleum in my Aunt Sharon's kitchen, the woods, the creek, and the drainage ditch that ran under the road by the country house I lived in as a child.

I had a wonderful nightmare a couple weeks ago, details I'd forgotten until I got in the shower. I took a shorter shower than normal that day, eager to get clean, get dry, and write down every little detail I could remember, because it was weird, and I could smell a story in there, somewhere.

I get most of my ideas in the shower, or just before I fall asleep. I like to think that's when my underbrain is most active, talking the loudest, and I'm always ready to listen. It's not convenient, but I'm not complaining.

Brushing my teeth before bed last night, and a handful of details about a character in a story that's been lurking in the back of my mind rose up, unbidden, welcome as an old friend. A window opening up into the life of a young boy, lonely, on his last day on earth.

I can see him, riding the bus one last time, and I can hear his conversation with the bus driver, and I can hear the panic in his mother's voice when she realizes he's not coming home that night, and maybe not ever again.

What I see isn't a memory, not really. But it's close. It's a kissing cousin. The bus driver is the old, loud guy who drove the bus when I was this kid's age, and I recognize the kid's shy, nervous smile, and a thousand other details. I feel bad about what's going to happen to this kid, because he reminds me of someone I know and care about.

And underneath that, I get an idea what's going to happen may not be so bad. Not in the long run. In the short run? Sure, absolutely. And I feel bad for his mom, I do.

I start with a plan, and I work from an outline, but I'm still just excavating. Digging, exploring, discovering what happens as I go along. That's writing, baby.
