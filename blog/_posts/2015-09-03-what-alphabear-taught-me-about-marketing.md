I’ve been playing Alphabear, the latest game from [Spry Fox](http://spryfox.com/), since early July. It’s a fun word puzzle game with progressively more difficult stages, plenty of unlockables, and adorable graphics. Right out the gate, Alphabear is hitting me on a lot of levels. These are some of my favorite things! But I’m not interested in talking about the game mechanics.

I want to talk about its growth engine. The team at Spry Fox have built some clever growth mechanics into the game itself, and they've made me think about how I approach marketing.

Let's get some backstory out of the way. I don't play many iOS games, but sometimes I'll cruise through the app store's top rated games, or check out a game recommended by a friend. I first heard about Alphabear through a Tweet from my friend Steve. Friend Steve is a skilled and skeptical programmer. He’s about as resistant to marketing as anyone I’ve ever met. But Steve shared screenshots from his own Alphabear games several times.

My friend Steve is actively hostile to marketing. So why did he choose to spread the word about Alphabear? Why this game, and not some other game? It's thanks to Alphabear’s ingenious little growth engine. At the end of a game, you're presented with a bear saying a funny phrase. Think MadLibs, with certain key words filled in from words you created during your game.

You’re also prompted to share this image: via email, message, or on social media.

It’s a nice growth engine, and it’s gotten better since launch. After a recent update, I noticed a button I could press to shuffle the phrase my bear said. This was a nice way to change up the result, making it more likely I would find something funny enough to share with others. I had a nice Twitter exchange with Spry Fox after noticing this:

That’s the thing about building a [growth engine](/blog/marketing/2015/08/24/building-a-growth-engine.html) into your product. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to be simple, compelling, and automatic. It should offer something to your users in exchange for spreading the word about your product. In Alphabear’s case, you’re sharing something funny with your friends. You’re also spreading the word about the game itself. This is how you turn users into signal boosters for your idea.

It’s a low-effort, highly-scalable marketing tool for Alphabear, and it worked.
