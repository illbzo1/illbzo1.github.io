I’m a dude who likes a blueprint, and I’ve got several thousand dollars worth of Lego sitting in the closet of my home office to prove it. So when I set out to do anything new, I like to read up on how others have gone about doing that thing. I like best practices. I like a roadmap, and I do well with an outline.

I like writing advice, even though there’s no such thing as good writing advice.

This holds true for <em>all</em> advice, sure. But I’m interested in talking about writing advice, specifically. Writing advice isn’t inherently “good” or “bad”. It’s either useful, or useless. I finished the <em>Kick Ass Writer</em> by [Chuck Wendig](http://terribleminds.com/) last week. While The Kick Ass Writer is chock full of useful, practical advice, Wendig himself admits his advice isn’t set in stone. It’s something you should take with a grain of salt.

<blockquote>
  The goal isn’t to deliver truth unto you. The goal is not to inflict my ways and rules upon you. The goal is to make you think. We should think about what we do.
</blockquote>

His book of writing advice is just a collection of ideas, strategies, and thoughts that have worked for him. Every piece of advice you’ve ever been given is just something that’s worked at some point for someone else. Sometimes it’s useful. Sometimes it’s not!

<blockquote>
  We think of sentences as being written down and thus related to the eyes, not the ears — but good writing sounds good when spoken. Great writing is as much about the ear as it is about the eye.
</blockquote>

The best editing tip I’ve ever heard is to read what you’ve written out loud. Yes, you'll feel stupid. You’ll probably sound stupid! What is this, elementary school? It’s <em>embarrassing</em>, and this is coming from a guy who doesn’t embarrass easily.

But it works. Good writing <em>sounds</em> good. It’s pleasing to the ear, and sentences that look beautiful in print often sound wrong when you actually hear them. You’ll trip over bad phrasing and awkward construction when you read what you’ve written out loud. Hearing what you’ve written is the best way to fix these problems.

I often think about the difference between plot and story. Story is what happens - plot is the way the story unfolds. Story is the meat, and plot is the bone. Or story is the synthetic skin, and plot is the badass metal endoskeleton, if you want to get all cyberpunk. AND I DO!

But let’s talk about story for a minute. Story is why we’re here. It’s why writers write.

<blockquote>
  Stories move the world at the same time they explain our place in it. They help us understand ourselves and those near to us. Never treat a story as a shallow, wan little thing. A good story is as powerful as the bullet fired from an assassin’s gun.
</blockquote>

Writing is about storytelling, and plot is the vehicle for delivering a story. The two aren’t at odds. They’re not locked in eternal combat. Story and plot are inextricably linked. They need each other. They’re buddies.

<blockquote>
  Plot promises payoff. A good plot often betrays this promise and does something different than the audience expects. That’s not a bad thing. You don’t owe the audience anything but your best story.
</blockquote>

A good writer is someone who likes writing. If writing feels like a chore, why are you doing it? I’m not saying writing isn’t work. I’m saying it shouldn’t <em>feel</em> like work. I write because I love writing. I have a great time writing. When I go back and read something I wrote when my heart wasn’t in it, it’s obvious. It’s <em>garbage.</em>

<blockquote>
  Writers are made — forged, really, in a kiln of their own madness and insecurities — over the course of many, many moons. The writer you are when you begin is not the writer you become.
</blockquote>

You know what else is garbage? Anything I wrote longer than let’s say 6 months ago. This is a rolling window. I’m going to come back in March and roll my eyes at this blog post. You get better over time, and the only way to get better is by writing.

One final thought. I know I came in hot saying there’s no such thing as good writing advice. That’s <em>mostly</em> true. There aren’t many universals. Some of us like outlines. Some don’t. Some of us write in the morning, and some of us write at night. Here are three pieces of writing advice I think are universal, if you want to improve as a writer.

###Write every day.###

It doesn’t matter if you’re writing for an hour, or 100 words, or 2,000. The only path to being better at something is to practice, and writing is no different. Stop whining that you don’t have the time. We’re all busy! If you want to be a writer, make the time.

###Finish what you write.###

It doesn’t matter if you’re a pantser or an outliner. A gardener or an architect. You have to finish what you write. You have to get the first draft done. Just power through. The first draft is something you just have to get out of the way. A good first draft will have little to no resemblance to your final draft. It’s just a tool to get started, so you can get down to the real business of writing - rewriting.

###Simplify.###

Writing is rewriting. Now that you’ve gotten your first draft out of the way, let it rest for a while. Leave it alone for a day, or a week, or a month. Then go back, read what you’ve written, and be merciless. Kill your darlings, especially if they’re not doing useful work, and cut the fat. Believe me, there’s fat.

There’s always fat, unless you’re talking about a synthetic skin situation.
