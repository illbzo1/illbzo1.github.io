    These emails are part of DocRaptor's customer lifecycle campaign, and are sent at various key touch points during the customer's experience with the product: the first they successfully create a document, or if they haven't created a document within 24 hours of signing up.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    Researching customer behavior revealed that trialing users who created a successful document within 24 hours were far more likely to continue generating documents, and remain happy, satisfied, and paying customers.

  <p class="description-text">
    A follow up email is also sent upon user cancellation, and has proven to be a fantastic source for identifying weak points of the service, inform the development team in deciding whether or not to add or support a feature, and increase overall customer satisfaction.
