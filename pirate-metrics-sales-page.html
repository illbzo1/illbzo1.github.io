    Pirate Metrics is an application designed to help startups understand their customers, scale their businesses, and increase their monthly recurring revenue.

  <p class="description-text">
    I started by reading about problems startups ran into when scaling their businesses. Startups wanted dto know how to understand their current user base, and they wanted to know how to find more customers like the ones they already had. Recurring themes I noticed were finding new customers, and keeping existing customers. Pirate Metrics was designed to not only report on your customer behavior, but provide guidance on how to attract similar users, and this is the angle I focused on.

    I wanted to be a bit more playful with the copy for Pirate Metrics. The name itself references Dave McClure's "Startup Metrics for Pirates", and slightly irreverant (though still informative) copy was lots of fun to write.
