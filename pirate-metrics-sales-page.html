    I wanted to be a bit more playful with the copy for Pirate Metrics. The name itself references Dave McClure's "Startup Metrics for Pirates", and slightly irreverant (though still informative) copy was tons of fun to write.

    I started by researching startups. What I found was startups wanted to understand their current user base, keep their current customers happy, and find more customers. I took a revenue-heavy approach with the copy for this product. Pirate Metrics is a tool for startups, and startups need more runway. Always more runway.
