    I wanted to be a bit more playful with the copy for Pirate Metrics. The name itself references Dave McClure's "Startup Metrics for Pirates", and slightly irreverant (though still informative) copy was lots of fun to write.

    I started off by reading about problems startups had with scaling their businesses. One recurring theme I saw over and over was how to attract the right kind of customer, and how to retain their current customers. Pirate Metrics was designed to not only report on your customer behavior, but provide guidance on how to attract similar users, and this is the angle I focused on.
