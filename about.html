      <h3>I'm a writer.</h3>
      <p>
        I've been writing since I was 8 years old. That old saying "Writers like having written" is bullshit, if you ask me. I like writing. It's editing I can't stand, and that's a problem. I'm happier writing, drinking black coffee, chewing through a story. Some days it's like putting a machine together. Some days it's like something alive in my gut, and it's all I can do to type it out. Some days it's just work: boring, flat. But I love it, every second, every moment.
