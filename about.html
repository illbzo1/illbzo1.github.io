        I don't like talking about myself. If you know me in private life, this might be a surprise. I'm a known talker. But I've never been comfortable with writing about myself. Not really. I'm not interested in writing about where I come from or where I went to college. I'll stick to a list of the more important details about who I am, as a real, living person, mostly protein, with actual blood, teeth, hair, bones and everything.

        I've been writing since I was 8 years old. That old saying "Writers like having written" is bullshit, if you ask me. I like writing. It's editing I can't stand, and that's a problem. I'm happier writing, drinking black coffee, chewing through a story. Some days it's like putting a machine together. Some days it's like something alive in my gut, and it's all I can do to type it out. Some days it's just work: boring, flat. But I love it, every second, every moment.

      <h3>I like making people laugh.</h3>
      <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-5x pull-right"></i>
      <p>
      Everyone has two laughs. A polite company laugh and a real laugh. A laugh impossible to hold in, even in polite company. That's the one I'm after. Nothing in life is better or more rewarding than the laughter of someone I care about. Don't get me wrong: I'm not selfless. Roughly half of my delight in making a loved one laugh is my own pleasure in my own cleverness, my own wonderful wit, my sharp, metamorphic sense of humor. I'm funny, man. I'm fucking funny as hell.

      <p>
        I can't say I feel physical pain if I let a certain amount of time go by without learning something new, sharpening existing skills, or otherwise keeping my magnificent brain occupied. It's not a physical pain. It's more like a heavy, gray blanket that settles over me, slowly, surely. I don't even notice I'm wearing the fucking thing until every little thing in my life disgusts me. So I keep learning. I keep reading, I keep drawing, I keep working on things. I used to think boredom was the enemy. In my old age, I realize this is a bit simplistic, but that doesn't make it any less true.
