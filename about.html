      <h3>I'm a writer</h3>
      <p>
        I've been writing since I was 8 years old. That nasty old saying "Writers like having written" is bullshit, as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
      	I like writing. It's editing I can't stand, but it has to be done, and I'm getting better at it. I'm happiest writing, alone in my home office, early in the morning or late at night, drinking black coffee or cold water, chewing through a story.
      </p>
      <p>
     	Writing is my Work. All caps, as a sign of respect. It demands respect, because it's dangerous, and it's fragile. Some days the Work is like putting a machine together. Some days it's like there's something alive in my gut, and it'll burn me alive if I don't get it out. Some days the Work is just work - it's boring, and it's flat, and it has to be done. But I love it, every second, every moment.
