            <h3>I'm a writer.</h3>
            <p>
              I've been writing since I was 8 years old. Lately I've been writing long short stories. I'm told these are called "novelettes". I didn't know "novelette" was even a word until I finished one and a friend of mine clued me in.

            <h3>I like video games. Like, more than a friend.</h3>
            <p>
              Strangely enough, despite being a dude who is huge into video games and will talk to you at length about his preferences in Pokemon (SPOILER ALERT: Ghosts) I don't consider myself a gamer. It's never been something I found to be a valuable part of my identity. I might as well call myself a "right-hander" or a "brown hair-er".

            <h3>I'm into systems, not goals.</h3>
            <p>
            I want to make steady progress and constantly improve myself, not just hit specific metrics. I started off 2015 with these systems:
              <ul>
                <li>Write 500 words per day, and 1,000 on the weekends.</li>
                <li>Read a book on writing every month.</li>
                <li>Read a book on copywriting every month.</li>
                <li>Read a book on marketing every month.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, these are working out well for me. My brain hasn't felt this rad in years.

            Nothing in life is better or more rewarding than the laughter of someone I care about.
