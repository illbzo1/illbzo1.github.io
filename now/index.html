    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 6/26/2016.

      I've reached a point in my life that having a nice lawn is important to me. I've always enjoyed mowing our lawn on a regular basis, but last summer I went around, removing a ton of invasive weeds that had grown up in the yard and in cracks in the concrete. Earlier this year, I removed most of the dandelions by hand. Now I've bought a manual edger, and my current project is edging all of the sidewalks and our driveway. A friend bought a reel lawn mower (the old-timey, non-powered ones) and I'm giving serious thought to buying one myself.

      I'm still playing Dark Souls 3, but I haven't gotten around to beating it yet. I've gone back to Bloodborne, and I'm switching between the two. Dark Souls 3 is great, but it's a bit too fan servicey for me. Nearly every scenario or environment feels like a call back to the original Dark Souls, and comes across as a calculated attempt to tug at my heartstrings. By comparison, I think Bloodborne is one of the best games of all time, and it's a strong contender for my favorite game ever.

      <a href="https://app-press.com">App Press</a> has been growing, and we've added three new local hires since I joined the team. They're young and newly out of college. I think of my first job out of college, and it's rewarding to share what I've learned over the years. I remember working with senior team members at various jobs, and what I did and did not like about working with more experienced people, and I use that to set an example.

      I'm up to five finished short stories in rotation at various horror and sci-fi magazines. No luck yet, but I've completely gotten over my initial fear and anxiety at having someone else read my work. I don't have a nail to spike rejection letters like Steven King did when he started, but I've got a spreadsheet, and <a href="https://duotrope.com/">Duotrope</a>, and a goal of 100 magazine submissions by the end of the year. I'm up to 20 submissions so far, all rejections, mostly form rejections.

      I've been slacking a bit on my reading lately, but I'm currently working through <em>Getting to Yes</em>, by Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton. It's great so far, and it's the second book I've borrowed from the lending library I started at App Press.

      I don't have much else to report as far as learning new things or side projects go. I've gotten very lazy after work since I joined App Press full time in May, and I think a vacation is in my near future. So lazy right now!
