    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 4/9/2017.

      This month, I'm finally getting around to reading <em>I, Robot</em> by Isaac Asimov. It's another case where I've been avoiding a classical piece of fiction despite loving works that reference it or are outright influenced by it (see also: Blade Runner) and I'm looking forward to working on my baseline understanding of sci-fi classics.

      Persona 5 is taking up a huge amount of my free time lately. I've been a fan of the Persona games since high school (picked up Revelations: Persona for the PSX at my local Walmart when I was 17) and I'm super pumped to <em>finally</em> get my grubby mitts on P5. A lot of ideas and elements from old school Persona games have returned (gun weapons for all characters, nuclear damage type, demon negotiations) and it's nice to see that Atlus isn't making this series any less weird in response to its popularity.

      I'n not typically the biggest fan of space opera, but MAN do I love the Expanse. Currently working my way through season 2, and thoroughly enjoying every minute of it. I'm going to take back some of the bad things I've said about SyFy Originals.

      I've accepted a new product marketing manager position with <a href="https://www.packetfabric.com/">PacketFabric</a>, and will be starting on April 17. I'll be the first dedicated marketing hire, and I'm super pumped to work on such an interesting problem with a team of incredibly smart people.

      I've also committed to joining the <a href="http://www.indyhackers.org/">IndyHackers</a> board. We've been planning some cool events for the Indy tech community, and I'm having a lot of fun thus far.

      My monthly reading diet for April includes <em>The Pixar Touch</em> by David A. Price, <em>Competing Against Luck</em> by Clayton M. Christensen, and <em>Antifragile</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. I've already finished <em>The Pixar Touch</em> and have started <em>Competing Against Luck</em>. I'm saving <em>Antifragile</em> for the last week of April, as I'm pretty sure it's going to be a TOUGH READ.
