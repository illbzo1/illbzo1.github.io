  <h1><small id="small-header">What I'm Doing Now</small></h1>
  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 2/15/2016.
  </p>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been a lot more social lately. Between meetups, hanging out with friends, and meeting people, I'm spending more time around others. It's still draining (I don't think I'll ever be an extrovert) but draining in a <em>good</em> way, if that makes sense at all.
    </li>

      I've been borrowing a ton of graphic novels from the Indianapolis Public Library. I've recently finished the IDW run of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and next I plan to re-read Saga.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <em>Dexter's Final Cut</em> by Jeff Lindsay. It's rough going so far. It's been a while since I read a Dexter book, and I don't remember them being so boring. I'll finish it on principle, but at a chapter or two per night, it'll take a while.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been playing a ton of Sunless Sea on Steam. I've come to the recent realization that roguelikes absolutely ARE my thing.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm enjoying the current seasons of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the Venture Brothers. I'm working my way through Season 4 of Bob's Burgers.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been working on some cool projects with a few clients. I've really enjoyed the work I've done in 2016 so far.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also been meeting a ton of cool people who are doing big things. Have I mentioned how much I love the tech scene in Indy? I never felt at home in Indianapolis until I got involved with the Ruby community. It took me a few years, but I love living here now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Experiments</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Staying motivated and being more productive are two intertwined and overarching experiments for me. I'm always looking for new ways to think about how to get more out of my day, and I recently finished <em>Your Brain at Work</em> by David Rock. Being more aware of distractions, rising emotions, when I'm too exhausted to think clearly, or when I'm stuck in a mode of thinking has had a noticeable improvement in both my motivation and mood.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've changed up my writing routine a bit. Now that I've got several first drafts in the bank, I'm trying out an alternating system of writing a new first draft, and editing an existing draft until I feel comfortable letting Miss Lady read it, and then start submitting it for publication consideration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Still looking for a home for my first short story. I am now up to three rejections from horror and weird fiction magazines. My most recent rejection was actually the most helfpul - the first two were form rejections, and the most recent told me that while they liked the story and had a vigorous debate about purchasing it, it's going to be a hard placement at just under 10,000 words.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm reading <em>Start with Why</em> by Simon Sinek, and <em>The Productive Programmer</em> by Neal Ford. Enjoying both so far - <em>Start with Why</em> is especially applicable to my current professional interests.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been learning German with <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/illbzo1">Duolingo</a>. Not because I think German will be particularly useful, but because I've always wanted to learn it, and could never fit it into my school schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm still working through the Ruby track on <a href="http://exercism.io/illbzo1">Exercism</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've paused my work on these <a href="http://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/">JavaScript exercises</a> on W3. I'll get back to publishing my solutions on <a href="https://github.com/illbzo1/w3-javascript-exercises/">my Github account</a> once I finish up some of these Ruby exercises I've been doing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do brain training games count as learning? Let's say yes! I've been playing Lumosity in my spare time. I figure I play a lot of dumb iOS games anyway, and I might as well do something that <em>supposedly</em> improves neuroplasticity. I want my brain to be the best brain it can be.
    </li>
