  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 1/16/2016.

  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Still working my way through Season 3 of Bob's Burgers, and Season 2 of Key and Peele.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <em>Every House is Haunted</em> by Ian Rogers. This book has been on my radar for a while, and it's been a fun read so far. As a writer of short, weird fiction, I absolutely love reading other short, weird fiction.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been working on some cool projects with a few clients. I've really enjoyed the work I've done in 2016 so far.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also been meeting with a ton of cool people who are doing big things. Have I mentioned how much I love the tech scene here? I never felt at home in Indianapolis until I got involved with the Ruby community. It took me a few years, but I love living in Indy now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Still working on finishing my first short story of the year. I've been slacking on my writing.
    </li>
    <li>
      However, I <em>do</em> have a short story submitted for publication consideration. I'm waiting to hear back from the magazine.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm (still) working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm currently reading <em>Trust Me, I'm Lying</em> by Ryan Holiday. It's a great read, and it's made me even more skeptical of anything posted on a blog as "news".
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript January is well underway! I'm working through <em>JavaScript and jQuery</em> by Jon Duckett, and it's been fantastic. I've even been able to correct a handful of code typos as I go, and I'm much more comfortable with JavaScript than I was a couple weeks ago.
    </li>
