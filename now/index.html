  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 2/8/2016.
  </p>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Venture Brothers. I'm working my way through Season 4 of Bob's Burgers.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <em>Every House is Haunted</em> by Ian Rogers. This book has been on my radar for a while, and it's been a fun read so far. As a writer of short, weird fiction, I absolutely love reading other short, weird fiction.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also borrowing and reading a ton of graphic novels from the Indianapolis Public Library. I'm currently rereading the IDW run of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been a lot more social lately. Between meetups, hanging out with friends, and meeting people, I'm spending more time around others. It's still draining (I don't think I'll ever be an extrovert) but draining in a <em>good</em> way, if that makes sense at all.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm not playing much in the way of video games lately, but I <em>am</em> replaying Chrono Trigger on the Vita (the emulated Playstation version, also know as the "WORST" version of Chrono Trigger) and Sunless Sea on Steam.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been working on some cool projects with a few clients. I've really enjoyed the work I've done in 2016 so far.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also been meeting a ton of cool people who are doing big things. Have I mentioned how much I love the tech scene in Indy? I never felt at home in Indianapolis until I got involved with the Ruby community. It took me a few years, but I love living here now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Experiments</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been thinking a lot about my own daily happiness, after I finished reading <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> a couple weeks ago. I'm making a conscious effort to immerse myself in the task at hand, no matter what that task is, and it's making me happier and more productive. Even if the task is shoveling the driveway when it's 25 degrees outside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Speaking of productivity, I'm also keeping an eye on my own habits, and trying to identify things that are an obvious waste of time. I got really into a handful of iOS games over the holidays. I realized they were a near constant distraction, so I've deleted them. I've cleared my browsing history to keep me from checking in on time wasting websites. It's similar to not keeping junk food in the house. I can't trust myself not to eat all of it at once, so I just don't keep it around.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm slowly getting back into a good writing routine. I've just finished up the first draft of a second short story. My goal this year is to write shorter works - aiming for less than 6,000 words each, and I'm finding this harder to accomplish. My goal was twofold: fiction magazines typically want submissions less than 6,000 words in length, and I thought it would help me produce more work. This hasn't exactly proven to be the case, but I'm still trying this constraint.
    </li>
    <li>
      Still looking for a home for my first short story. I am now up to three rejections from horror and weird fiction magazines. My most recent rejection was actually the most helfpul - the first two were form rejections, and the most recent told me that while they liked the story and had a vigorous debate about purchasing it, it's going to be a hard placement at just under 10,000 words.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      My reading goals are off to a good start this year. I've got 5 nonfiction books under my belt thus far, and I'm currently working through <em>The Productive Programmer</em> by Neal Ford and <em>Your Brain at Work</em> by David Rock. Early thoughts: <em>The Productive Programmer</em> is a bit too tool-centric to be very useful, though it's got some good insights into speeding up routine tasks and processes. <em>Your Brain At Work</em> is great so far.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been learning German with <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/illbzo1">Duolingo</a>. Not because I think German will be particularly useful, but because I've always wanted to learn it, and could never fit it into my school schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've taken a quick break from the Ruby track on <a href="http://exercism.io/illbzo1">Exercism</a> to work through <a href="https://github.com/getfretless/sftraining/wiki/MR01-Mutant-Roster">this Ruby exercise</a> by my friends at <a href="http://www.getfretless.com/">Fretless</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also paused my work on these <a href="http://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/">JavaScript exercises</a> on W3. I'll get back to publishing my solutions on <a href="https://github.com/illbzo1/w3-javascript-exercises/">my Github account</a> once I finish up some of these Ruby exercises I've been doing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do brain training games count as learning? Let's say yes! I've been playing Lumosity in my spare time. I figure I play a lot of dumb iOS games anyway, and I might as well do something that <em>supposedly</em> improves neuroplasticity. I want my brain to be the best brain it can be.
