    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 5/7/2017.

      I'll be reading <em>The Ritual</em> by Adam Nevill this month. I've heard a lot of good things about this one, mostly from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/">/r/horrorlit</a>, and I'm pumped to check it out. I don't know anything about it other than it's supposed to be good.

      I'm about a hundred hours into Persona 5, though I'm nearing the endgame now. I'm kind of getting sick of playing it, though I really can't wait to see how the plot wraps up, and I absolutely did not see certain twists coming. I've enjoyed it, but not sure I'll be up for a second playthrough any time soon.

      I've also been re-reading East of West. I like a lot of the comics Image is publishing these days, and while I don't think East of West is quite as good as Saga, I <em>do</em> think it's as weird and complex. It's a strange, pre-apocalyptic ride with the Four Horsement, robot horses, talking eyeballs, shapeshifters, and demons from the abyss.

      Three weeks into my new gig at <a href="https://www.packetfabric.com/">PacketFabric</a>, and I'm learning a lot, going to bed exhausted every night, and getting ready for <a href="https://www.internationaltelecomsweek.com/this-year">ITW 2017</a> in Chicago in a couple weeks. Really looking forward to meeting some of the team and potential partners!

      We've had our first official <a href="http://www.indyhackers.org/">IndyHackers</a> board meeting, gotten a bit more organized, and officially moved over to Slack. (At long last, I've been able to uninstall Flowdock entirely!) We've got a lot of cool stuff planned, and I'll say more about that stuff when I can.

      In May, I'll be reading <em>Sprint</em> by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, and Braden Kowitz, <em>Liars and Outliers</em> by Bruce Schneier, and <em>Antifragile</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. I'm almost done with Sprint, and I've found it to be useful from a high level, though I'm annoyed at the specific phrasing for various concepts. Still haven't gotten to <em>Antifragile</em> - I've been a bit intimidated to start it, based on various friends' reviews. Intimidation is a sucker's game, though, and I'll get to it this month!
