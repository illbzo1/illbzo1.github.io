  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 5/15/2016.

      Jessica's gotten me into The Americans, and we've been watching a few episodes a week. It's great - policital, tense, darkly funny - in short, right in my wheelhouse! Between The Americans, Game of Thrones, and Penny Dreadful, it's basically all dark drama, all the time in this house. With occasional breaks for Steven Universe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

      I'm still playing a ton of Dark Souls 3. True to form, I haven't actually beaten the game yet, despite having over a hundred hours spread between 10 different characters. I love making new builds in Souls games, and trying out weapons and spells. With so many new characters, the lack of branching paths in Dark Souls 3 is annoying. It's slightly less linear than Bloodborne, and it's not the biggest problem, but I find myself missing the Master Key from the first Dark Souls. Even Dark Souls 2 felt less linear. Still - it's tons of fun, and I'm not complaining that much. I mean, I <em>have</em> clocked a hundred hours in the past month.

      I joined <a href="https://app-press.com">App Press</a> full time as Marketing Director on May 2. It's really exciting to work on such a cool product with a smart team. I've gotten a ton of positive feedback from friends and professional connections (which sounds weird to me to say) but it's been great. I had a competing offer from another local tech company, and while the choice was very difficult, every day I'm sure I made the right decision.

      I'm doing fairly well with my short term editing goal. I completed a third short story this past week, and began submitting it for publication on Saturday. Once I have five finished pieces in rotation, my plan is to switch between writing something new, then editing an older piece, and so on. I'm still getting ideas for new stories, but they come more slowly when my focus is on editing an existing story, rather than creating something new.

      I'm doing well on my yearly reading goal of 30 books. According to my spreadsheet, I've read 16 books for professional development so far. Not bad for the first 5 months of the year! Next up is <em>The Obstacle is the Way</em>, by Ryan Holiday. I'm a big fan of his work, and this should be a quick, fun read.

      As promised, I've started a <a href="https://github.com/illbzo1/scripts">repo on Github</a> for little scripts I've written to help me do various tedious tasks. I'm not laboring under any delusions that this is fantastic code, but it's a fun side project. I spend much less time in my professional life working with code these days, and this is a good way to keep working with Git.
