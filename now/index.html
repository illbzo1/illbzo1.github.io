    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 4/17/2016.

      I'm spending a lot of time playing Dark Souls 3. Most recently, I've beaten the first big boss (Souls games always have 4 bosses you have to kill as part of the storyline) and I'm having a great time. I'm playing through blind, and it's incredible to discover how all the mechanics work for myself, rather than spending time on forums and reading what a hundred thousand strangers have found out. In many ways, Dark Souls 3 feels <em>too</em> fan-servicey, with too many call backs to the original Dark Souls, but that's a pretty minor complaint on my part. It's polished, and fun, and I'm getting my shit kicked in on the regular. What more could I ask for from a Souls game?

      I've been reading a ton of graphic novels and trade paperbacks from the library. Most recently, I've read the IDW Ghostbuster series and Lumberjanes. Comics are a great way to fit just-for-fun reading into my schedule. Have I mentioned how much I love the <a href="http://www.indypl.org/">Indianapolis Public Library</a> system? And libraries in general!

      I'm wrapping up a big website redesign project using <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>. It's really designed for design agencies with many customer websites, not a single project, but thus far Webflow's the best CMS I've ever used. Miles above similar products like Wordpress and Squarespace.

      I'm still working on my short term editing goal, which is to have five finished short stories in rotation for publication consideration. My yearly goal is 100 submissions, and according to the <a href="http://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/">Submission Grinder</a> I'm currently sitting at 7. Hitting 100 for the year should should be easy enough once I've got 10 finished stories. Still plenty of time in the year, and I've got lots of first drafts just waiting for me to come back, read what I've written, and cringe so hard I give myself a migraine.

      I'm reading <em>The Art of the Start 2.0</em> by Guy Kawasaki, and <em>still</em> working through<em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. Still slacking in my reading. Still working on it!

      I've been writing a bunch of small Ruby scripts to do various things lately - parse an XML file to quickly find all URLs for the website migration I've been working on, help me divide a book I'm reading into 10 equal segments to schedule nightly reading, and so on. These are dumb little scripts that don't take more than a few minutes to put together, but I'm probably going to start a Git repo to hang onto these guys.
      <br />
      <br />
      Seems like a good way to document scripts I've written, rather than writing them once, running them, and then deleting that file. This is advice taken straight from <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>, by the way, so even though it's taking me a thousand years to read, I'm definitely picking up good ideas from it.
