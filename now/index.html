  <p>
    This is a list of what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that can never replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of seeing a friend after time has passed, and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 11/1/2015.

  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Jessica and I are getting closer to adopting cats. We look at the <a href="http://www.indyhumane.org/">Indianapolis Humane Society</a> every day, but we haven't made the trip over there yet. I want kittens. She wants "established" cats. She wants to adopt two grandpas with tiny little strollers.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm rewatching the <a href="http://www.venturebrosblog.com/">Venture Brothers</a> from Season 1. I'm currently working through Season 3. At this rate, I should be all caught up when Season 6 starts in 2016.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am actively enjoying the current seasons of Steven Universe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Fargo. I am watching, though not exactly enjoying, the current season of American Horror Story.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the second year in a row, I am really into how beautiful the trees in Indiana look in the fall. I distinctly remember how I felt this time last year, when Jessica and I were house shopping. I think about everything that's happened since then, and I'm glad we're together, and I'm glad we are where we are. I am getting soft in my old age.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <a href="http://craphound.com/down/download/">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>. I've mostly been reading for professional development this year, so I'm making it a point to read more fiction.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A few weeks ago, I sent a short horror story I wrote to 20 beta readers found through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've started implementing changes based on feedback from the 10 who responded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once I've finished these edits, I'm going to try my hand at getting published in a horror magazine that accepts this type of story.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am aware of a weakness when it comes to editing my work. Currently, I have 12 short stories written. That's 8 first drafts, 3 second drafts, and 1 nearly finished draft (the story I mentioned earlier, sent to beta readers.) Publication is something I plan to pursue in the new year, so I am making a conscious effort to get better about editing my work. I don't have any illusions that all 12 of these stories are great, or even good, but they finished, and if they can be polished, I <em>should</em> polish them.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/hooked">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</a>. This book's been on my radar for a while, and I'm really enjoying it so far.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working with a few clients on their marketing and growth strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also exploring other interesting career opportunities! Freelancing is fun, and I love the freedom, but long-term I want to be part of a team. I find I'm spending too much time wrangling clients, and not enough time spent doing the kind of data-driven marketing work I love.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Personal Development</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm running a handful of personal marketing experiments. I like to run experiments for a month or so - anything from seeing if answering marketing questions on Quora will drive traffic to my site to trying and measuring new channels for content distribution. I've found a month is a short enough time span that I don't lose focus, and long enough that I can evaluate an experiment for impact. I'm a huge fan of short feedback loops, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also working to improve my writing style (killing as many adverbs as possible, for starters!)
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm using <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> and <a href=:"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> to stay organized.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have recognized that my own education is not complete, and that it <em>should</em> never be complete. This was originally a <a href="https://twitter.com/illbzo1/status/660208910633009152">Tweet</a>, but I like it so much I'm putting it here. It's a good thing to think about.
