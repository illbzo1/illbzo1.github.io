  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 1/22/2016.

  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I'm still working my way through Season 3 of Bob's Burgers.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <em>Every House is Haunted</em> by Ian Rogers. This book has been on my radar for a while, and it's been a fun read so far. As a writer of short, weird fiction, I absolutely love reading other short, weird fiction.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been a lot more social lately. Between meetups, hanging out with friends, and meeting people, I'm spending more time around others. It's still draining (I don't think I'll ever be an extrovert) but draining in a <em>good</em> way, if that makes sense at all.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been working on some cool projects with a few clients. I've really enjoyed the work I've done in 2016 so far.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also been meeting a ton of cool people who are doing big things. Have I mentioned how much I love the tech scene in Indy? I never felt at home in Indianapolis until I got involved with the Ruby community. It took me a few years, but I love living here now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Experiments</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been thinking a lot about my own daily happiness, after I finished reading <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> a couple weeks ago. I'm making a conscious effort to immerse myself in the task at hand, no matter what that task is, and it's making me happier and more productive. Even if the task is shoveling the driveway when it's 25 degrees outside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Speaking of productivity, I'm also keeping an eye on my own habits, and trying to identify things that are an obvious waste of time. I got really into a handful of iOS games over the holidays. I realized they were a near constant distraction, so I've deleted them. I've cleared my browsing history to keep me from checking in on time wasting websites. It's similar to not keeping junk food in the house. I can't trust myself not to eat all of it at once, so I just don't keep it around.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working through my second short story of the year. I wasn't happy with my first draft and started a complete rewrite. This is usually a <em>bad idea</em>, but I'm much happier with the direction of this second take.
    </li>
    <li>
      Still looking for a home for my first short story. I am now up to two - count them, <em>two!</em> rejections. No worries! On to the next magazine. This story's a bit heavier than most short fiction outlets prefer (it clocks in at just under 10,000 words) but I think it's solid, and I'm going to exhaust the possible publications before I give up and move on to another story. If nothing else, submitting this story has been great practice.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm (still) working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <em>Do More Faster</em>, by David Cohen and Brad Feld. Great perspectives on startups, business, technology, and failure from a ton of smart people.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm still working on developing a better understanding of JavaScript. I'm working through <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, by Douglas Crockford. I'm also doing these <a href="http://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/">JavaScript exercises</a> on W3, and publishing my solutions on <a href="https://github.com/illbzo1/w3-javascript-exercises/">my Github account</a>.
