  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 4/3/2016.

      I'm still (patiently) waiting for Dark Souls 3 to release on the 12th, and until then I've been playing a lot of dumb iOS games, and Salt and Sanctuary. Salt and Sanctuary is basically a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and a Metroidvania game. It's slightly more complex than that, and I'm having a fun time with it, despite my slight irritation at the art style.

      Miss Lady's brother Bob got married last night, and we had a great time at the wedding reception in the <a href="https://indyarts.org/artsgarden/monthly-calendar">Indianapolis Arts Garden</a>. Lots of drinking, dancing, early 90s jams played at 900 decibels, and catching up with old friends and family.

      <a href="http://www.app-press.com">App Press</a> is going well. My first couple of weeks were spent on a number of smaller projects, and lately I've been working closely with Grant, the CEO, and one of App Press' designers on a long term project we're hoping to ship later this month. It's a great team, and I'm doing good, interesting work every day. It's hard to ask for more than that.

      Writing is going well! I now have another finished short story in rotation, and it's already been rejected twice. The fact I get excited about rejections is a good sign. Even though it's discouraging, it's good to put my work out there and let others read it.

      I'm reading <em>The New Rules of Marketing and PR</em> by David Meerman Scott, and still working through<em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. I'm slacking in my reading these days. I'll have to work on a habit to get back on track. Spending more than two weeks to read a book is unacceptable!
    </li>

      Speaking of slacking, I've been meaning to start working through <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> by Marijn Haverbeke for a while now. It's funny what a full time job out of the house will do for my reading schedule, but I've left it on my desk to SHAME me into cracking it open this week.
