    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 1/9/2016.

      This month, I'm reading <em>Company Town</em> by Madeline Ashby. I've heard a lot of good things about it, and as you may know I'm a huge fan of cyberpunk.

      I've been playing a ton of Stardew Valley and Pokemon Sun over the last few weeks. Both are way more fun than they have any right to be. My only real complaints are that after Year 1 in Stardew Valley, there's not much left to do or see, and Pokemon Sun is a bit too easy. Yes, I am aware that this is a game marketed to children - still!

      Every new year is a great time for reflection on the previous year, and to start planning the year to come. We're a few days into the new year as I write this, but I'm trying a few different things this year. First, I'm publishing first drafts every week to this website. Second, in an effort to eliminate waste from my life, I'm trying an experiment in being more frugal. Jessica and I have been recycling for years, and it's cut our garbage output dramatically, but I still waste quite a bit. A couple bucks on a cookie here, a few dollars on a game I never play there. I'm thinking more carefully about every purchase, no matter how small.

      This year, I'm focusing on two long-term writing projects: writing and publishing a <a href="/first-drafts">first draft</a> each week on this website, and self-publishing a finished collection of short stories.

      I'm still enjoying my work at <a href="https://www.app-press.com">App Press</a>. I've been learning a lot about product marketing and onboarding since we launched the Build plan back in October.

      I've set myself a goal of reading 3 non-fiction books each month. I'm most interested in learning more about product marketing, but I'm expanding my reading diet outside of immediately practical books. This month, I'm reading <em>Do the Work!</em> by Steven Pressfield, <em>The Innovator's Dilemma</em> by Clayton M. Christensen, and <em>Elon Musk</em> by Ashlee Vance.
