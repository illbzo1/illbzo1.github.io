  <p>
    This is a list of what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 12/8/2015.

  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm playing both Fallout 4 and Bloodborne. I fully expect these to keep me busy well into the new year.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am actively enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Fargo, Jessica Jones, Steven Universe, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I am watching, though not exactly enjoying, the current season of American Horror Story. I wouldn't say I'm "hate watching" it exactly, but it definitely feels like I'm watching out of obligation.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been thinking a lot about hardware hacking lately (likely due to reading The Design of Everyday Things) and have made plans to hang out with some local friends and hardware enthusiasts this weekend. Pretty excited!
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm shopping a finished short story around to various publications.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've finished editing a second short story, and am working my way through a third. Feeling pretty good about my progress here!
    </li>
    <li>
      I've rediscovered a love of reading physical books. Most of my reading this year has been on my iPad, and I'm making it a point to read more actual books now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm (still) working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <a href="http://www.jnd.org/books/design-of-everyday-things-revised.html">The Design of Everyday Things</a>. It's been sitting around on my bookshelf for years, and I'm finally getting around to reading it. It's often very dry, but has given me lots of food for thought. Now everything in my house is a problem, from our stove top to the light switches in the hallways.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working with a few clients on their marketing and growth strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also exploring other interesting career opportunities! Freelancing is fun, and I love the freedom, but long-term I want to be part of a team. I find I'm spending too much time wrangling clients, and not enough time spent doing the kind of data-driven marketing work I love.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Personal Development</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm running a handful of personal marketing experiments. I like to run experiments for a month or so - anything from seeing if answering marketing questions on Quora will drive traffic to my site to testing new channels for content distribution. I've found a month is short enough that I don't lose focus, and long enough I can evaluate an experiment for impact. I'm a huge fan of short feedback loops, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also working to improve my writing style (killing as many adverbs as possible, for starters!)
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm using <a href=:"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>, the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>, and <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> to stay organized.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have recognized that my own education is not complete, and that it <em>should</em> never be complete. This was originally a <a href="https://twitter.com/illbzo1/status/660208910633009152">Tweet</a>, but I like it so much I'm putting it here. It's a good thing to think about.
