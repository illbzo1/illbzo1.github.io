    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 3/12/2016.

      I'm re-reading <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/saga">Saga</a> (AKA one of my favorite comic series of all time, and you should ALL read it!)

      I'm becoming more interested in hardware hacking and the internet of things. I spent last weekend with some friends, who were working on various hardware projects, and got a build kit from my friends at <a href="https://www.getstructure.io/">Structure</a> this week. I'm super excited to start playing with their platform this weekend! Let's build some robots!

      Miss Lady and I have some fairly serious yard projects to do soon. First up, transplanting some bushes from our patio area to either side of our driveway. I've never done this before, but I did watch a YouTube video about it, so I'm fairly certain I'm an expert at transplanting bushes.

      I'm enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the Venture Brothers, and still waiting for Steven Universe and Game of Thrones to return. Spring is in the air, and winter is coming!

      I started working with <a href="http://www.app-press.com/">App Press</a> on Monday. My first week was great, and it's really cool to be working in Fountain Square, out of the Hinge Bureau. Kind of strange to be in an office full time again, but the view is pretty nice, and the drive gives me plenty of time to catch up on podcasts.

      My current writing goal is to finish up a few more stories and start submitting them for publication consideration. Thus far, I've finished one story in over a year of fiction writing, and I've got a few that are dangerously close to being submission ready. These are shorter works that should be easier to get published, and I'm focusing on putting the finishing touches on them and then trying to find homes for them. Pretty exciting!

      I'm still working on beefing up my Ruby skills. This past week at <a href="http://indyrb.org/">Indy.RB</a>, we split into groups to hack on an open source library (<a href="https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf/blob/master/generators/wicked_pdf/templates/wicked_pdf.rb">WickedPDF</a>) and I spent some time working with RuboCop. I thought I'd just wind up drinking beer and hanging out, but I accidentally opened a PR to fix some RuboCop complaints, and hopefully make the code a bit more readable and succinct.

      I'm reading <em>The Power of Habit</em> by Charles Duhigg, and <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. <em>The Power of Habit</em> has a ton of good insight into how habits are formed, and how we can change our own habits. I'm still enjoying <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> but it'll likely take me longer to finish. Good stuff, though!
