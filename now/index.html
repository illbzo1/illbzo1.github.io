  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 1/18/2016.
  </p>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Still working my way through Season 3 of Bob's Burgers, and Season 2 of Key and Peele.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <em>Every House is Haunted</em> by Ian Rogers. This book has been on my radar for a while, and it's been a fun read so far. As a writer of short, weird fiction, I absolutely love reading other short, weird fiction.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been a lot more social lately. Between meetups, hanging out with friends, and meeting people, I'm spending more time around others. It's still draining (I don't think I'll ever be an extrovert) but draining in a <em>good</em> way, if that makes sense at all.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been working on some cool projects with a few clients. I've really enjoyed the work I've done in 2016 so far.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also been meeting with a ton of cool people who are doing big things. Have I mentioned how much I love the tech scene here? I never felt at home in Indianapolis until I got involved with the Ruby community. It took me a few years, but I love living in Indy now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Experiments</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've been thinking a lot about my own daily happiness, after I finished reading <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> a couple weeks ago. I'm making a conscious effort to immerse myself in the task at hand, no matter what that task is, and it's making me happier and more productive. Even if the task is shoveling the driveway when it's 25 degrees outside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Speaking of productivity, I'm also keeping an eye on my own habits, and trying to identify things that are an obvious waste of time. I got really into a handful of iOS games over the holidays. I realized they were a near constant distraction, so I've deleted them. I've cleared my browsing history to keep me from checking in on time wasting websites. It's similar to not keeping junk food in the house. I can't trust myself not to eat all of it at once, so I just don't keep it around.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've finished my first short story of the year! I'm making a concerted effort to write shorter fiction this year. That is, fewer 10,000+ word novelettes. I'm setting a temporary goal of 6,000 words or less. This first one clocked in at a slim, trim 1,032 words, and was a ton of fun to write.
    </li>
    <li>
      Still waiting to hear back from the magazine that's currently considering something I submitted earlier this month. I kind of love rejection letters. It's part of being a writer, and I find someone saying "This isn't for us" strangely encouraging. Even if it's a form rejection.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm (still) working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've recently finished <em>Trust Me, I'm Lying</em> by Ryan Holiday. Wonderful, depressing, eye-opening read about how easily our culture of iterative journalism is manipulated by marketing and PR professionals. Next up - <em>Do More Faster</em>, by David Cohen and Brad Feld.
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript January is well underway! I'm nearly finished with <em>JavaScript and jQuery</em> by Jon Duckett, and it's been fantastic. I've even been able to correct a handful of code typos as I go, and I'm much more comfortable with JavaScript than I was a couple weeks ago.
    </li>
