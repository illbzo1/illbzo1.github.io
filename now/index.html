    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 3/1/2016.

      <em>Bird Box</em> by Josh Malerman has been on my to-read list for a while now. It's frequently mentioned on /r/horrorlit and /r/horror, and I'm excited to check it out later this month. I have no idea what it's about - just that it's highly recommended by other horror fans.

      Horizon: Zero Dawn came out on February 28, and I picked it up immediately. I even stayed up late to play it for a bit after midnight. So far, I'm really enjoying it - it's a neat take on post-apocalyptic future, with fantastic creature designs (mostly robotic dinosaurs) and interesting combat mechanics.

      I've been doing some work with <a href="http://www.indyhackers.org/">IndyHackers</a> - just helping out with the newsletter for now, with longer term goals of helping the group become more organized and doing some marketing and event work. I've been looking for ways to get involved with a community I've grown to love, and having a great time so far!

      In March, I'm reading <em>Disrupted</em> by Dan Lyons, <em>Algorithms to Live By</em> by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, and <em>Unmarketing</em>, by Scott Stratten. Last year, I read a long article by Lyons about writing <em>Disrupted</em> (<a href="http://fortune.com/disrupted-excerpt-hubspot-startup-dan-lyons/">a memoir about his time at Hubspot</a>) and I'm super excited to read the rest. <em>Algorithms to Live By</em> has been recommended by several friends, and seems like a nice change of pace from my normal reading diet.
