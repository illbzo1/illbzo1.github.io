  <p>
    This is a list of what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 11/12/2015.

  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Jessica and I are getting closer to adopting cats. We look at the <a href="http://www.indyhumane.org/">Indianapolis Humane Society</a> every day, but we haven't made the trip over there yet. I want kittens. She wants "established" cats. She wants to adopt two grandpas with tiny little strollers.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am playing a ton of iOS games: Alphabear, Boom Beach, Clash of Clans, Final Fantasy Record Keeper, Monument Valley, and Neko Atsume. I've never been much for iOS games (aside from Sudoku) so this is a bit strange for me.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also playing Fallout 4. I've been a fan of the series since I picked up the first Fallout in an electronics store in my hometown back in 1998. Having a great time so far!
    </li>
    <li>
      I've been rewatching The Venture Brothers from the beginning for the last month or so. All I have left are the Halloween special, and "All This and Gargantua 2". It's funny how much I'd forgotten, but then again, there IS a two year break between each season.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am actively enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Fargo, Steven Universe, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I am watching, though not exactly enjoying, the current season of American Horror Story. I wouldn't say I'm "hate watching" it exactly, but it definitely feels like I'm watching out of obligation.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <a href="http://craphound.com/down/download/">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>. I've mostly been reading for professional development this year, so I'm making it a point to read more fiction.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working on the final edit of a short story, after implementing feedback from several beta readers. The next step is to to try my hand at getting published in a horror magazine.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am aware of a weakness when it comes to editing my work. Currently, I have 12 short stories written. That's 8 first drafts, 3 second drafts, and 1 nearly finished draft. Publication is something I plan to pursue in the new year, so I'm making a conscious effort to get better about editing my work. I don't have any illusions that all 12 of these stories are great, or even good, but they're finished, and if they can be polished, I <em>should</em> polish them.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've rediscovered a love of reading physical books. Most of my reading this year has been on my iPad, and I'm making it a point to read more actual books now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <a href="http://www.jnd.org/books/design-of-everyday-things-revised.html">The Design of Everyday Things</a>. It's been sitting around on my bookshelf for years, and I'm finally getting around to reading it.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working with a few clients on their marketing and growth strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also exploring other interesting career opportunities! Freelancing is fun, and I love the freedom, but long-term I want to be part of a team. I find I'm spending too much time wrangling clients, and not enough time spent doing the kind of data-driven marketing work I love.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Personal Development</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm running a handful of personal marketing experiments. I like to run experiments for a month or so - anything from seeing if answering marketing questions on Quora will drive traffic to my site to testing new channels for content distribution. I've found a month is short enough that I don't lose focus, and long enough I can evaluate an experiment for impact. I'm a huge fan of short feedback loops, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also working to improve my writing style (killing as many adverbs as possible, for starters!)
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm using <a href=:"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>, the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>, and <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> to stay organized.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have recognized that my own education is not complete, and that it <em>should</em> never be complete. This was originally a <a href="https://twitter.com/illbzo1/status/660208910633009152">Tweet</a>, but I like it so much I'm putting it here. It's a good thing to think about.
