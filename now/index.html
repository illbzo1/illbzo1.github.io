  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 1/2/2016.
  </p>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm still playing Bloodborne, though I'm *just* about done playing it. I think! Hard to say with any Souls game, to be honest.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm waiting for all my favorite shows to start back up (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Adventure Time, Steven Universe) and in the mean time I'm working through Season 1 of Bob's Burgers and Season 2 of Key and Peele.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm about halfway through Starship Troopers, and while military sci-fi really isn't my thing, I'm enjoying it. It's a world in which teenagers join up with the Space Army while their fathers read newspapers, smoke cigars, and disapprove of their sons' life choices.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm excited about a few things that are happening in 2016. Finally out of the holiday slump, and I'm pumped to get back to work. Let's do this!
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've started working through my writing goals for 2016, and I'm about 2/3 of the way through my first short story of the year.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've recently renewed my library card, and rediscovered my love of the library. The library makes me feel like a kid again, and it's an economical way to read. I don't really hang on to most books, anyway.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm (still) working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a>. It's enjoyable so far, though a bit dry and academic for my taste.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Professional Development</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      One of my goals in January is to become more familiar with and proficient in JavaScript. I'm calling it "JavaScript January," and I'm super pumped about learning to love JavaScript. Or not hate and fear it as much, at least.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've got a longer blog post about this in the works, but I've got a list of things I want to make in 2016. Inspired by Justin Jackson's <a href="http://megamaker.co/challenge/">2016 Maker Challenge</a>, I've got a list of things I want to make in 2016. I don't think I'll hit 100 things to build, but it sounds like fun. I've got a blog post coming with more details!
