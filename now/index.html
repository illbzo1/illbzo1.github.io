  <p>
    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 1/2/2016.

  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      2016 is off to a good start. Here we are, in the second week of January, and I already have (almost) too much on my plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've recently renewed my library card, and rediscovered my love of the library. The library makes me feel like a kid again, and it's an economical way to read. I don't really hang on to most books, anyway.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm almost done with <em>Starship Troopers</em>, and <em>Every House is Haunted</em> is next up on my fiction reading list.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've recently finished reading <em>Flow: The Psychology of Happiness</em> and I plan to start <em>Trust Me, I'm Lying</em> tonight.
    </li>
    <li>
    I've been reading <em>JavaScript and jQuery</em>, by Jon Duckett. I'm having a lot of fun working through the examples, and I'm having a much easier time understanding how JavaScript works. I wouldn't say I *love* JavaScript now, but I'm definitely much less fearful of it.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I've almost finished my first short story of the year. My current plan is to write a first draft, then edit an existing draft, then write another story, and so forth.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm still working on getting a short story published. Currently I'm planning to submit a short story to at least one magazine per month. Publication is high on my priority list for 2016.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm (still) working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript January is underway! In early February, I'm planning on publishing a blog post about what I learned in January, and how I put together a JavaScript course for myself.
    </li>
    </ol>

      I'm working through Bob's Burgers season 2, and enjoying the current seasons of Steven Universe and Adventure Time. Can't wait for some other favorites to come back on the air, now that the holidays are over!
