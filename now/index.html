    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 3/2/2016.

      Winter is on its way out, and Miss Lady and I have been taking advantage of the handful of warm days to get a head start on yard work. The joys of home ownership include raking leaves I was too lazy to rake in the fall, disposing of a hundred thousand sticks blown down from our trees, and planning out how Jessica's gardens for the year.

      I'm re-reading <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/saga">Saga</a> (AKA one of my favorite comic series of all time, and you should ALL read it!)

      I'm still playing Sunless Sea, and I've started another new playthrough of Fallout 4, focusing on luck and strength. It's fun, but it's not exactly holding my attention. I'm iffy on open world games anyway, and just about every game I've played recently feels like a way to kill time until Dark Souls 3 comes out in April.

      I'm enjoying the current seasons of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the Venture Brothers. I'm waiting for Adventure Time and Steven Universe to return, and I recently started watching Season 1 of Rick and Morty. Friends have recommended this show for years, and I held out because it seemed too LOL RANDOM! for my taste, but it's actually <em>incredible.</em> Favorite episode thus far: Rick Potion Number 9.

      I've gotten into a better system for writing new stories and editing existing stories. I alternate between writing something new and editing an existing story. I don't want to spend forever endlessly tweaking a story before I let someone else read it, so I give myself two edits. The first edit is for fixing big problems with the story, and the second is for phrasing changes, copy edits, and other minor improvements. Then I hand it off to Miss Lady to read, incorporate any changes she's suggested that I agree with, perform one final edit, and then it's off to submission land.

      I'm still looking for a home for my first short story, and I'm getting close to having two more stories in a reasonable enough shape that I feel comfortable submitting them. These are both shorter than my first (2,500 and 3,700 words, as opposed to just under 10k) and I think I'll have an easier time finding a home for both of them. As I've said before, publication isn't <em>the</em> goal, but it's <em>a</em> goal.

      I'm starting a new contract on March 7, working with a local SaaS company on their marketing efforts. I'm  excited, and I'll have more to say about this in the future!

      I'm still working through the Ruby track on <a href="http://exercism.io/illbzo1">Exercism</a>. The exercises are getting easier to work through, and I've settled into a nice rhythm. I still outline the problem as best I can, and then submit the first, dumbest working solution I come up with. Then I refactor as best I can, and leave comments on my work to talk through what I'm doing. It's been great fun!

      I'm reading <em>Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys to Creativity</em> by Hugh MacLeod, and <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. <em>Ignore Everybody</em> is fun so far, and I'll likely finish it tonight. Sometimes I enjoy a quicker read. It's nice to take a break from books that take a week or two to finish. I've been meaning to read <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> for years. A friend of mine gave it to me for Christmas a few years ago, and it feels good to <em>finally</em> make time for it.
