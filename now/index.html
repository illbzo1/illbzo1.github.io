  <p>
    This is a list of what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 12/18/2015.

  <h2><small id="small-header">Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm playing both Fallout 4 and Bloodborne. I fully expect these to keep me busy well into the new year.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am actively enjoying the current seasons of Adventure Time, Jessica Jones, Steven Universe, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I am watching, though not exactly enjoying, the current season of American Horror Story. I wouldn't say I'm "hate watching" it exactly, but it definitely feels like I'm watching out of obligation.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am newly inducted into the world of transistors, LEDs, switches, and hardware hacking thanks to some friends. We've tentatively scheduled another weekend in early March, and I'm super excited.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading more for pleasure. Next on my list is Starship Troopers, though I am lazy, and haven't actually started reading it yet. Maybe tonight!
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I have received my first official rejection from a magazine. It felt strangely good - like a rite of passage. I'm still looking into publication, and it's something I'll take a lot more seriously in 2016.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've rediscovered a love of reading physical books. Most of my reading this year has been on my iPad, and I'm making it a point to read more actual books now.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm (still) working through the <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer">Google Analytics Academy</a>. I've been using Google Analytics for years, but most of my learning has been self-guided, or based on tutorials I've followed to solve a specific problem. I'm learning a lot through a dedicated, deep look at how Google Analytics works.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm currently reading <a href="http://thankyoueconomybook.com/">The Thank You Economy</a>. It's a good book about the value of sincerity (a common theme in many books I've read this year) and it's caused me to take a second look at the value I place on social media when it comes to marketing.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working with a few clients on their marketing and growth strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also exploring other interesting career opportunities! Freelancing is fun, and I love the freedom, but long-term I want to be part of a team. I find I'm spending too much time wrangling clients, and not enough time spent doing the kind of data-driven marketing work I love.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small id="small-header">Professional Development</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm already working on a list of books to read next year. I've been thinking a lot about my career and where I want to go in the next year, the next five years, and the next ten, and what tools I'll need to get there.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm running a handful of personal marketing experiments. I like to run experiments for a month or so - anything from seeing if answering marketing questions on Quora will drive traffic to my site to testing new channels for content distribution. I've found a month is short enough that I don't lose focus, and long enough I can evaluate an experiment for impact. I'm a huge fan of short feedback loops, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also working to improve my writing style (killing as many adverbs as possible, for starters!)
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm using <a href=:"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>, the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>, and <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> to stay organized.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have recognized that my own education is not complete, and that it <em>should</em> never be complete. This was originally a <a href="https://twitter.com/illbzo1/status/660208910633009152">Tweet</a>, but I like it so much I'm putting it here. It's a good thing to think about.
