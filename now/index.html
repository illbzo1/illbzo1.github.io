  <h1><small>What I'm Doing Now</small></h1>
  <p>
    This is a list of what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that can never replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of seeing a friend after time has passed, and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 10/28/2015.

  <h2><small>Life</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Jessica and I are getting closer to adopting cats. We look at the <a href="http://www.indyhumane.org/">Indianapolis Humane Society</a> every day, but we haven't made the trip over there yet. I want kittens. She wants "established" cats. She wants to adopt two grandpas with tiny little strollers.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm rewatching the <a href="http://www.venturebrosblog.com/">Venture Brothers</a> from Season 1. At this rate, I should be all caught up when Season 6 starts in 2016.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am actively enjoying the current seasons of Steven Universe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Fargo. I am watching, though not exactly enjoying, the current season of American Horror Story.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the second year in a row, I am really into how beautiful the trees in Indiana look in the fall. I remember distinctly how I felt this time last year, when Jessica and I were house shopping. I think about everything that's happened since then, and I'm glad we're together, and I'm glad we are where we are. I am getting soft in my old age.

  <h2><small>Writing</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A few weeks ago, I sent a short horror story I wrote to 20 beta readers found through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've started implementing changes based on feedback from the 10 who responded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once I've finished these edits, I'm going to try my hand at getting published in a horror magazine that accepts this type of story.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small>Learning</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I finished up the <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> on Tuesday, October 27. I wish I'd read this years ago. I still have trouble understanding how to write my own methods, but the Koans helped reinforce a lot of other things I understand about Ruby and programming in general.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm reading <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">Traction</a>. Lots of great ideas about marketing products at multiple stages of their lifecycles.
    </li>
    </ol>
  <h2><small>Work</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm working with a few clients on their marketing and growth strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also exploring other interesting career opportunities! Freelancing is fun, and I love the freedom, but long-term I want to be part of a team. Freelancing requires too much time spent wrangling clients, not enough time spent doing the kind of marketing work I love.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><small>Personal Development</small></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I'm running a handful of personal marketing experiments.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm also working to improve my writing style (killing as many adverbs as possible, for starters!)
    </li>
    <li>
      Every day is a struggle to stay organized. <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> and <a href=:"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> have proven to be fantastic project management tools.
    </li>
    <li>
      I recognize that people rarely act out of spite, but out of rational self-interest. (Which can seem like spite.)
    </li>
