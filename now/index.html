    This is what I'm doing lately. What's new in my life. It's a summary that isn't meant to replace a real conversation, but I'm sick of running into friends and struggling to answer the question "What've you been up to, man?"

    This is what I've been up to, and this list was last updated on 2/6/2016.

      This month, I'm reading <em>The Deep</em> by Nick Cutter. I found it last year on a list of best modern horror novels, and it's been sitting on my nightstand since I picked it up at Half Price Books in the fall. Time to actually read this bad boy!

      I've gotten super into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_gacha">gacha games</a> in the last week or so. I've been playing Final Fantasy Record Keeper casually for about a year and a half, and now I'm also playing Final Fantasy Brave Exvius and the newly released Fire Emblem Heroes. It's gacha games all the way down.

      I've also been playing <a href="http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/">AM2R</a> lately. Metroid 2 is one of my childhood favorites (up there with Final Fantasy Adventure and Super Mario Land 2). It's a shame Nintendo shut this project down, but it's still fairly easy to get your hands on a copy. Nice excuse for busting out the USB SNES controller I worked on a couple years ago.

      Pursuant to my often-stated goal of saying "yes!" to more things, I've been reaching out to some friends about potential collaborative projects, advisory work, and help with marketing. Nothing super concrete to talk about yet, but I'm actively looking for more projects to get involved with.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also got some ideas for personal projects - stupid things I often <a href="https://twitter.com/illbzo1">tweet</a> about, but never actually follow through with. Been toying with the idea of adding a "Side Projects" section to this site - we'll see!

      My reading list for February includes <em>Improv Wisdom</em> by Patricia Ryan Madson, <em>To Sell is Human</em> by Daniel H. Pink, and <em>Give and Take</em> by Adam Grant. I've already finished up Improv Wisdom and found it to be wonderfully insightful, and a great read for anyone who has trouble remembering to say "yes" to new experiences (like yours truly.)
