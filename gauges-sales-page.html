    This was a rewrite of Gauges's sales page intended to improve conversion rate. Before working on this copy, I ran a successful AdWords campaign for Gauges, and I used the ads that performed best as a guide when writing the sales copy.

  <p class="description-text">
    Data from the Ad Words campaign showed that selling Gauges as a simple, easy to share analytical tool worked. Gauges target audience doesn't want something as complex as Google Analytics, and its simplicity is the feature I highlighted with the copy. The updated copy has proven to be a success, with improvement both in trialing users, and paid conversions.
