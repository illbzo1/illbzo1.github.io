    This was a rewrite of Gauges's sales page, intended to improve conversion rate. I'd been running a successful AdWords campaign for Gauges, and I used the ads that performed best as a guide when writing the sales copy.

    The PPC ads that performed the best were ads that sold Gauges as a simple, easy to share analytical tool. Gauges target audience doesn't want something as complex as Google Analytics, and its simplicity is the feature I highlighted with the copy. The updated copy has proven to be a success, with improvements in trial signups, and paid conversions.
