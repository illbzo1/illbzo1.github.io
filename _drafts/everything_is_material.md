Reading through Bird by Bird, and this quote struck loudly enough I had to jump up and write a draft blog post based on it:

"So much of writing is about sitting down and doing it every day, and so much of it is about getting into the custom of taking in everything that comes along, seeing it all as grist for the mill."

Everything is material. Every person I know, every song I've ever heard, the linoleum in my Aunt Sharon's kitchen, the woods, the creek, and the drainage ditch that ran under the road by the country house I grew up in.

I had a wonderful nightmare a couple weeks ago, details I'd forgotten until I got in the shower. I took a shorter shower than normal that day, eager to get clean, get dry, and write down every little detail I could remember, because it was weird, and I could smell a story in there, somewhere.

I get most of my ideas in the shower, or just as I'm about to fall asleep. I like to think that's when my underbrain is most active, talking the loudest, and I'm always ready to listen.
