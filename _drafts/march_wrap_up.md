Anne Lamott - Bird by Bird

I loved the way Lamott talked about writer's block: as a problem of being empty, rather than being stuck. And her encouragement to approach all writing, no matter how small, with everything you have. To not hold back for fear of using up your talent, because the more you give, the more you'll have.

The best part of reading books about writing is connecting with someone I'll never meet, someone who I may have almost nothing in common but love of this craft. I don't know that I'd like Lamott if I met her, but I enjoyed the picture she painted of her life as a mother, a friend, a daughter, and a writer.
