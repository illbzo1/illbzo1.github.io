  <h1><small>PPC Campaigns</small></h1>
  <p class="description-text">
    I've run several successful PPC campaigns, using Google Adwords and Bing Ads. I enjoy writing ad copy based on how the target audience is searching, running ads, evaluating, rewriting, and running new ads.
  <p class="description-text">
    PPC campaigns are a great way to continuously improve, and I find writing compelling copy in a limited space an interesting challenge.

  <h2><small>Codifferous Google AdWords campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text bold">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    I ran this campaign after a week interviewing developers around the globe, learning how professional developers talked and thought about code review. I spoke to nearly 40 developers via email, phone, video chat and Skype, then I wrote ad copy using words I heard repeated during these interviews. I wanted to address the common pain points felt by busy developers who would love to review more code, if only they could find the time.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    I positioned Codifferous as a faster, simpler, and easier code review tool. For this specific group of ads, I was testing how various headline and value propositions worked, given the same call to action.

  <h2><small>Gauges Google AdWords campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text bold">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    Before starting this campaign, I wanted to understand how Gauges' user base talked about Gauges. What did they like? How did they talk about Gauges? I dug through old support threads, social media mentions,links from blog posts, and comments on forums. People loved Gauges' simplicity, real time updates, and the ability to track multiple sites in a single dashboard. This was a fantastic place to start writing ad copy that worked.

  <h2><small>Instrumental Bing Ads campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text bold">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    For this campaign, I wanted to know if <em>application monitoring</em> was a valuable search term to target for Instrumental. This campaign was part of a big overhaul for Instrumental. Data from this campaign provided valuable insight for writing sales copy that worked. I worked with a designer to create landing pages for an application monitoring campaign, and ran a PPC campaign on the Bing Ad network, targeting search terms related to application monitoring.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    The target audience was developers who cared about application performance and monitoring. My research indicated DuckDuckGo was popular with developers, and used the Bing Ads network. I chose Bing Ads as a place to start, rather than AdWords, to gain access to developers searching on DuckDuckGo.
