    This was a rewrite of Gauges' sales page intended to improve conversion rate. People were signing up, using the product, and paying. I just wanted <em>more</em> of them. I started with a successful AdWords campaign for Gauges, and used the ads that performed best as inspiration for the sales copy rewrite.

  <p class="description-text">
    Data from the AdWords campaign showed that selling Gauges as a simple, easy to share analytical tool worked. Gauges' target audience doesn't want something as complex as Google Analytics, and I highlighted the simplicty of the product with the new sales copy. This updated copy has proven to be a success, with improvement in trial signups and paid conversions.
