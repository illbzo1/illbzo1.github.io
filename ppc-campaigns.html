  <h1><small>PPC Campaigns</small></h1>
  <p class="description-text">
    I've run several successful PPC campaigns, using Google Adwords and Bing Ads. I always start with keyword research to identify valuable keywords to target, determining a goal for the campaign, setting a budget for the campaign, and monitoring ad performance during the campaign.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    PPC campaigns are a great way to continuously test and improve, and writing compelling copy in a very limited space is an interesting challenge.

  <h2><small>Codifferous Google AdWords campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text bold">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    This campaign ran after I spent a week interviewing developers around the globe, figuring out how professional developers talked and thought about code review. I used words and phrases I'd heard repeated often during my interviews to write ad copy. I wanted to address the common pain points felt by busy developers who would love to review code, if only they could find the time.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    I wrote ads positioning Codifferous as a faster, simpler, and easier code review tool. For this group of ads from the campaign, I was testing how various headline and value propositions would perform, given that all ads had the same call to action.

  <h2><small>Gauges Google AdWords campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text bold">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    I started this campaign by trying to understand how Gauges's existing user base talked about Gauges. What did they like? How did they talk about the things they liked about Gauges? I dug through old support tickets, social media mentions, and links from blog posts and forums. People loved Gauges for its simplicity, real time updates, and the ability to track multiple sites in a single dashboard. A fantastic place to start writing ad copy that worked.

  <h2><small>Instrumental Bing Ads campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text bold">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    For this campaign, I wanted to figure out if "application monitoring" was a valuable search term to target for Instrumental. This campaign was part of a big overhaul for Instrumental, and the data would inform changes in Instrumental's positioning, as well as provide insight for writing sales copy that worked. I worked with a designer to create landing pages for an application monitoring campaign, and ran a PPC campaign on the Bing Ad network, targeting search terms related to application monitoring.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    I chose Bing Ads over Google Ads for two reasons: my research indicated Bing Ads would be less costly than Google Ads for the same keywords, and DuckDuckGo uses the Bing Ad network. DuckDuckGo is a search engine that's popular with developers, and this is the audience I wanted to reach.
