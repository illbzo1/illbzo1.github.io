  <h1><small>PPC Campaigns</small></h1>
  <p class="description-text">
    I've run several successful PPC campaigns, using both Google Adwords and Bing Ads. For each campaign, I began by doing keyword research to identify valuable keywords to target, then set a budget for the campaign, and monitored ad performance during the campaign.

  <p class="description-text">
    PPC campaigns are a great way to continuously test and improve, and I've found writing compelling copy with a very limited space to be an interesting challenge.

    I targeted search terms related to code review pain points uncovered by interviewing developers, and crafted ad copy around those paint points. Over and over, developers were telling me the same thing: they thought code review was a good idea, but indepth code review was too hard, and took too long. Given this information, I wrote ad copy positioning Codifferous as a faster, simpler, and easier tool for code review. With this group of ads, I was testing how various headline and value propositions would perform, given that each ad had the same call to action.

    I researched how existing users talked about Gauges by reviewing old support tickets, social media mentions, and links from blog posts and forums. People who liked and paid for Gauges appreciated its simplicity, and the ability to track multiple sites in a single dashboard, so that's where I started when writing advertising copy.

  <p class="description-text">
    This was a campaign to determine whether a specific search term was valuable for Instrumental. In this case, I was targeting "application monitoring". I chose the Bing Ad network rather than Google Ads, for two reasons: research demonstrated Bing Ads would be less costly than Google Ads for the same keywords, and DuckDuckGo also uses the Bing Ad network. DuckDuckGo is a search engine that's increasingly popular with developers, and this is the audience I wanted to reach.
    <br />
    <br />
    This campaign was paused due to a change in Instrumental positioning.
