  <h1><small>PPC Campaigns</small></h1>
  <p class="description-text">
    I've run several successful PPC campaigns, using both Google Adwords and Bing Ads. For each campaign, I began by doing keyword research to identify valuable keywords to target, then set a budget for the campaign, and monitored ad performance during the campaign.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    PPC campaigns are a great way to continuously test and improve, and I've found writing compelling copy with a very limited space to be an interesting challenge.

  <h2><small>Codifferous Google AdWords campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    This campaign ran after I spent a week interviewing developers around the globe. I used words and phrases I'd heard repeated often during my interviews, writing ad copy to speak directly to pain points felt by busy developers who would really love to review code, if only they could find the time!
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    Given this information, I wrote ad copy positioning Codifferous as a faster, simpler, and easier tool for code review. With this group of ads, I was testing how various headline and value propositions would perform, given that each ad had the same call to action.

  <h2><small>Gauges Google AdWords campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    I started this campaign by researching how Gauges existing user base talked about Gauges. I looked through old support tickets, social media mentions, and links from blog posts and forums. People who liked and paid for Gauges loved its simplicity, and the ability to track multiple sites in a single dashboard, so that's where I started when writing advertising copy.

  <h2><small>Instrumental Bing Ads campaign</small></h2>
  <p class="description-text">copywriting, keyword research, campaign management</p>
  <p class="description-text">
    For this campaign, I wanted to determine whether "application monitoring" was a valuable search term to target for Instrumental. I worked with a designer to create landing pages for an application monitoring campaign, and ran a PPC campaign on the Bing Ad network, targeting search terms related to application monitoring.
  </p>
  <p class="description-text">
    I chose the Bing Ads over Google Ads for this campaign for two reasons: my research indicated Bing Ads would be less costly than Google Ads for the same keywords, and DuckDuckGo uses the Bing Ad network. DuckDuckGo is a search engine that's increasingly popular with developers, and this is the audience I wanted to reach.
