    <strong>Data Doesn't Solve Problems. Information does.</strong>
    <br />
    Instrumental tracks the metrics that matter most to your application, with nearly instantaneous updates, and we do it at scale.
    <br />
    <strong>Completely Customizable Metrics</strong>
    <br />
    Your test suite is specifically tailored to your application, and your application monitoring should follow suit. You define the metrics, and we'll show you how your application is performing in real time.
    <br />
    In Instrumental, every metric is either incremented, gauged, or timed:
    <br />
    For an event (e.g., signups) use an increment call. For values that vary from moment to moment use a gauge call. Use the time call to wrap code and record the time it takes to complete.
    <br />
    <strong>Powerful Query Language</strong>
    <br />
    It's not enough to build graphs and track events - our query language allows you to run complicated queries against your data, graph that information in real time, and adapt more quickly when problems arise.
    <br />
    <strong>Billions of Data Points</strong>
    <br />
    Instrumental is designed for any size application - we comfortably process and display billions of metrics every day. With minimal latency between processing and displaying your information, we give you insights into your application performance in seconds - not hours.
    <br />

    <strong>Application monitoring isn't just looking at pretty graphs.</strong>
    <br />
    The most beautiful graphs in the world are useless if they don't help you make better decisions.
