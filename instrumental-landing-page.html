  <p class="description-text">
    This is one half of a long-running test for Instrumental. I wrote copy for two landing pages, ran PPC ads on the Bing Network targeting search terms related to <em>application monitoring</em>, and did a ton of research prior to a big repositioning for the product.

  <p class="description-text">
    I worked with the designer to create two variations on landing pages for the application monitoring campaign. The goal of this campaign was not only to determine whether application monitoring itself was a good search term to target, but what tone converted better with the target audience.
