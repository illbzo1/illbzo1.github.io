This site uses Jekyll for serving pages and Foundation for CSS.

Helpful links:

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

Running the site locally:

    jekyll serve

Dumb way to preview content before publication:

  Edit head.html, swap in localhost:4000 for tylermoore.website. Yes, I know. This is really stupid but it works for now.

To do:

* smarter templating (IE we probably don't need a separate layout for each static page)
* clean up index (latest blog post is displaying, doesn't look great)
* add categories to blog index
* add comments to blog
* redo blog styles (search by tag, category, etc)
* publish April wrap up post
* publish "Being Strict" post
