  <p><a href="http://www.billbryson.co.uk/index.php/mother-tongue-the-story-of-the-english-language-2/">The Mother Tongue</a> by Bill Bryson wasn’t the book I thought it was going to be. I found it on some listicle late last year. when I was skulking around the internet, looking for books to read on writing.</p>

<p>I wanted to front load a ton of good books on copywriting, marketing, and writing for my reading this year, so I dug through a ton of garbage lists, looking for common threads. I held my nose and rooted through a bargain bin stuffed full of clickbait headlines. I dug through loathsome pieces of internet trash with headlines like Top 23 Writing Books of All Time, or 14 Books on Writing You Won’t Believe (Number 6 Is Insane!)</p>

<p>The Mother Tongue was on more than one, of that I’m sure. It’s a book more about linguistics and the evolution of the English language than the nuts and bolts, practical approach to writing, editing, plotting, character development, and other elements of the Craft I was hoping for.</p>

<p>Still, I read it. Finishing the book took longer than I budgeted, but it was interesting. Little known fact: I love etymology. I took an etymology class when I was a junior in high school. It was graded on a curve, and I set the curve for every test. I’m good at words.</p>

<p>But let’s talk about the book.</p>

<p><em>“We tend to slur those things most familiar to us, particularly place-names.”</em></p>

<p>Oh, yes. Absolutely. I’m from southern Indiana, and it was several years after I moved north for college before I stopped pronouncing “Louisville” as “Lou-uh-vulle,” or even “Luh-vulle.” Fascinating that we’re most careless with names most familiar to us. I can think of numerous times I stepped carefully over an unfamiliar word, careful to get it right, while slurring the names of my closest friends, familiar locations, favorite video games, movies, books, and TV shows.</p>

<p><em>“Considerations of what makes for good English or bad English are to an uncomfortably large extent matters of prejudice and conditioning.”</em></p>

<p>This brought a couple of things to mind while I was reading, so I made a note, and emailed it to myself for later thought.</p>

<p>For a long time, I took bad spelling or poor grammar to be a sign of a lack of intelligence. It wasn’t until I was well into my 20s that I figured out this isn’t true. Some people aren’t good at language. I’m not good at math, or physics. It doesn’t mean I’m an idiot. I am in fact, quite smart, and the same holds true for many people who can’t tell the difference between they’re, their, and there.</p>

<p>I’m not much of a grammarian. My own grammar is shaky at best, most of the time. Sometimes for effect, sometimes through carelessness or my own spotty education. Bad grammar doesn’t bother me. I’m willing to let it slide.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is no excuse for poor spelling. I don’t embarrass easily, but catching spelling mistakes in my own work, or in my Twitter feed, or in anything I’ve written and shown to another person always causes me to curse myself for an idiot, a FRAUD.</p>

<p>Chapter 14 was all about swearing. Most cultures swear. It seems to be a natural part of human expression, and it was fascinating to read about the age of words like “shit” and “fuck”, as well as how many different slang terms for “penis” there are.</p>

<p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> a lot.</p>

<p>The Mother Tongue was a fun read, but how useful will it be, really? Will having read it make me a better writer? I don’t think so. I didn’t find any urge to jump up, stop reading, and start writing while working through the book. Still, it made me laugh, and while it was perhaps not the best use of my time, I’m not exactly cursing myself for a fraud for having read it.</p>
