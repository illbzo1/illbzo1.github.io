        <title>Wrangling Jekyll for Blogging</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Good news! I’ve finally mastered the fine art of using Jekyll to add a blog to my wonderful site. It actually wasn’t that difficult. Most of my time was spent exploring the deep, dark caverns around properly setting a base_url until I just said “FUCK IT” and went with my root domain, which I’ll swap out for local development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it’s actually way easier than I thought it would be. I have a long-standing, nasty habit of building very simple tasks up to be monumental undertakings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I plan to spend some time this weekend porting all of my old blog posts over from blogspot, then fully migrating everything here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Styling is still pretty boilerplate, but I’ll get to that. The main thing is the blog is up, it works, and it’s easier than I thought it would be. BONUS: made quite a bit of improvement with the layout, updating templates to be more templatey, DRYing shit up every, son.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I Did in February; Or, the Nightmare of Copy Editing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I came out of February having read three more books, having written thousands of words, and discovered something about myself and how much I love copy editing. &lt;strong&gt;SPOILER ALERT:&lt;/strong&gt; not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Wrote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that I have to go back through my Twitter feed for notes on what I wrote in any given month. I finished up one short story, began an edit of the first story I finished in January, and started another story. Cross-referencing Twitter in this way is dumb, so I’ve added another sheet to my progress tracking spreadsheet. That spreadsheet’s getting pretty fat, man. I’ve got lots of progress I want to track!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That old saying “Writers like having written” is hot, boiling garbage. I like writing, and I spent several blissful mornings drinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackheartenterprises.com/&quot;&gt;cold, black coffee&lt;/a&gt; and banging out a story. I sat down with a printed copy of my first draft, red pen in hand, only to find editing my own writing a chore beyond imagining. I’d rather have been writing something new. I’d rather have been anywhere but editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Just finish one pass. Just one first edit, then you can start another story.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the credo I lived by for over a week. I kept finding reasons not to edit my first draft. Somehow I made it through, though I’m still about halfway through a second pass. I blamed various interferences - a lack of good red pens, or discomfort in my computer chair when I sat down to edit. Just a string of shitty excuses to keep myself from doing the work that I knew needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll need to find a way to weasel editing into my daily routine. Some system for editing, a clever way to trick myself into it. Maybe I edit for 20 minutes every evening. After buying some new red pens, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X&quot;&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Strunk and White&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m what? 90% sure I’ve read this before? I’m reasonably certain this was required reading in one of my early journalism classes. Either way, the refresher was wonderful. This old bastard dates back to 1918, and the advice contained still feels fresh, nearly a century later. Strunk has no patience for sloppy writing, and I love that he calls poorly constructed sentences “indefensible”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Permission-Marketing-Turning-Strangers-Customers/dp/0684856360&quot;&gt;Permission Marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Seth Godin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to just put all of the other marketing books I’m planning to read this year on hold until I’ve worked through Godin’s entire library. Permission Marketing is an old book (first published in 1999) and it shows its age when Godin writes about specific companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the specifics don’t matter. He writes with self-effacing humor and a natural curiosity that makes discussion of otherwise dry, technical case studies a true pleasure to read. I’ve read a couple of his other books (The Dip, All Marketers are Liars) and he’s never disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Persuasive-Online-Copywriting-Take-Words/dp/0971476993/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425703297&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=persuasive+online+copywriting&quot;&gt;Persuasive Online Coypwriting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Bryan Eisenberg, Jeffrey Eisenberg, Lisa T. Davis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve kind of been doing a “thing” with dated online marketing books. This one was good, not as enjoyable to read as Permission Marketing, but reinforcing modern standards of online copywriting: focus on benefits, measure conversions, keep your eye on the fucking ball. Your visitors don’t give a shit about you. They give a shit about what you can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I Felt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February felt pretty good. I didn’t get as much writing done as I’d have liked (see that week spent copy editing) and I’ve discovered I dislike editing my work. This is almost certainly a “thing” for at least some set of writers, and I need to get over it. I plan to implement a new system for editing in March, considering I’ve got a handful of first drafts under my belt now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of my first story was painful, but productive. I cut out a lot of shit, removed tons of ideas that weren’t working and didn’t go anywhere, but I got bogged down in the second pass. It might be time for another, just to take what I have now, print it out again, and start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll pass it off to Miss Lady for further editing, and that idea is terrifying. Writing a story is one thing, but letting someone else read what I’ve written? AIEEEEEEE&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I Did in January: My Super Rad Writing System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Wrote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using my super rad writing system (500 words per day, and 1,000 words per day on the weekends) I’ve written rough drafts for two short stories and I’m most of the way through a third. It’s hard to calculate just how far I am into this third story. I’ve discovered something interesting about writing fiction - it doesn’t always go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve scoffed at people who write without an outline (and I still do, it’s MADNESS) but I have been surprised more than once at events that unfold while I’m writing. A character will make a surprise trip to a butcher’s shop, and it all feels very natural even though I didn’t plan on it in my rough outline before sitting down to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly those hilarious gems from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nanowrimo_txt&quot;&gt;@nanowrimo_txt&lt;/a&gt; make more sense. But not much more - let’s not get crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the first story using textedit, using folders and a ton of text files. This was not ideal, and I knew it, but it’s how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully planned to switch to either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulyssesapp.com/&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php&quot;&gt;Scrivener&lt;/a&gt; for the next story. I downloaded trials for both, but ended up using &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; when it came time to sit down and write, at the recommendation of my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://mileszs.com/&quot;&gt;Miles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,”&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;em&gt;“This works fine. Better than a folder full of disorganized and loosely connected text files. But I’ll give one of the other apps a shot on the next story.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. Didn’t happen. I’m still sticking with Evernote. It’s got the feature set I want (easy to organize stories and groups of stories, cloud sync, accessible from any device I can log into) without the bloat of something like Scrivener. Protip: If I have to go through a 400-step tutorial to use your writing software, I am not going to use your writing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ulysses is more light weight and seemed like a reasonable alternative, but I find it to be comparable in feature and usage to Evernote, so I don’t have a compelling reason to switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke a bit about my writing system in my last post, but I haven’t mentioned my reading system. In short, I want to read three books per month: one book on writing, one book on copywriting, and one book on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I read in January:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425703880&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=on+writing&quot;&gt;On Writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Stephen King&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Writing was a singular joy to read, and I wish I’d read it a decade ago. Stephen King is the reason I wanted to be an author as a child, and this book was the perfect combination of memoir and practical writing advice from a master of the genre. Bonus: tons of interesting insights into horror stories I read in high school, how he wrote them, where he was when he wrote them, and the impact they had on his family’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425703914&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=ogilvy+on+advertising&quot;&gt;Ogilvy on Advertising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by David Ogilvy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogilvy on Advertising and The Copywriter’s Handbook were less enjoyable to read, but full of practical information. I was surprised to find Ogilvy on Advertising felt less dated than The Copywriter’s Handbook, likely because Ogilvy focused less on specifics than Bly did. Ogilvy’s relentless focus on provable, measureable results is fascinating. He was talking about data-driven marketing (a common enough practice in 2015) way back in the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Copywriters-Handbook-Step---Step-Writing/dp/0805078045/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425704153&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=copywriter%27s+handbook&quot;&gt;The Copywriter’s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Robert Bly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copy of The Copywriter’s Handbook I read had a new section on writing for the web (this version was published in 2005 or so) and felt hilariously dated in 2015. Tons of mentions of “e-zines”, for example, although the strategies Bly wrote about in 2005 still apply today (collecting emails, running drip campaigns, selling with benefits). Again, much like Ogilvy: work on something you can measure. Try new approaches, measure the results, get better over time. Solid, practical advice for any marketer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread I noticed in all three of these books is each writer takes a practical, craftsman-like approach to writing. These aren’t flowery authors. They write about the “craft” of writing, not the “art”, which appeals to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts on My Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month in and I’m feeling good about these systems. I’ve gotten a lot more done in a single month than I typically do, and that persistent, nagging feeling that I should be using my spare time more productively has all but vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already thought of ways to extend and improve these systems - bumping up my word count, for example, and keeping notes on the book I’m reading as I read it. This would help with summary blog posts at the end of the month, and I’d be able to talk about a book I read three weeks ago with more salient points than “It was good, I liked it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, off to a good start. Feels good to talk about things I’ve done, not things I plan to do. I feel less pressure to keep a promise I’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this and you’ve got book recommendations, writing tips or anything else you’d like to rap about, I’m all ears. You’ve been on the internet before. You know how to leave a comment on a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
