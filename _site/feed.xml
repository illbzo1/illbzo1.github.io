        <title>the tipping point</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/&quot;&gt;Tipping Point&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Gladwell is about why ideas spread. Why teen smoking continues to rise, despite vigorous anti-smoking campaigns. Why cracking down on graffiti and fare jumping in New York City lead to a steep decline in violent crime. Why Airwalks were incredibly popular for a few years in the mid-90s, and why their popularity died off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about understanding the driving forces behind ideas that spread. It’s about understanding the people who exert the right amount of influence at just the right time. Many of the studies cited in the Tipping Point were also used as background material in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.influenceatwork.com/&quot;&gt;Influence&lt;/a&gt;. More than once I found myself thinking &lt;em&gt;“Oh, yeah, I remember that one.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing books are also psychology books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tipping Point covered a ton of disparate ideas, from Paul Revere’s midnight ride (and the other rider that night, a man who wasn’t nearly as successful at spreading the same information) to Broken Window theory, to how people behave differently, in different circumstances, and armed with different information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to turn a seminary student, who is about to give a lecture on the Good Samiritan, into an asshole? Tell him he’s late. It works. You can effect dramatic changes, and it doesn’t take much. Just a little push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To appreciate the power of epidemics, we have to abandon this expectation about proportionality. We need to prepare ourselves for the possibility that sometimes big changes follow from small events, and that sometimes these changes can happen very quickly.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the tipping point. It’s the point just before something makes an impact. It’s the point at which adoption rates skyrocket, and new behaviors or changes in attitudes move from early adopters to the early majority. It’s the moment of critical mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Crossing the Chasm by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geoffreyamoore.com/&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Moore&lt;/a&gt; a couple years ago, and I found myself thinking about that book several times while reading The Tipping Point. If a Tipping Point happens at all when you’re trying to Cross the Chasm, I think it happens somewhere here. On one side, or the other, of the Chasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/crossing-the-chasm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; title=&quot;The Tipping Point, and Crossing the Chasm&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an idea, product, service, behavior, or any other emerging trend moves from the early adopters to the early majority, it’s much more likely to spread. And continue to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When a virus spreads through a population, it doubles and doubles again, until it has (figuratively) grown from a single sheet of paper all the way to the sun in fifty steps.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. Like a virus. Absolutely love this example, by the way. It’s a fantastic way to illustrate the power of exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how do ideas spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want our ideas to spread. We want our users to fall in love with our products. We want readers to read our blogs. We want to convince absolute strangers to take the steps we want them to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the Law of the Few. The people with the particular and rare set of social gifts are Mavens, Salesmen, and Connectors. These are the people who have the information, the personality, and know the right people required to push something new in the right direction. The people who can push hard enough, or at just the right time that a ripple becomes a wave. Or an idea becomes a virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the image of ideas spreading like a virus. While reading, I thought about the people who spread new ideas as Carriers. The people who collect and share knowledge (Mavens) and the people with the personality and temperament to sell (Salesmen) and the people who spread ideas by bringing people together (Connectors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All willing carriers. Maybe it’s an unflattering way to think of people, but then again: saying something has “gone viral,” is a compliment. It means it’s made an impact. It means the idea has reached the Tipping Point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Influencers” is a more flattering way to think about these people, perhaps. I started thinking about the influencers in my own life. The people who spread ideas that have enriched my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladwell mentions an interesting thought exercise, in which he mapped a large number of his friendships to a single, original friend who introduced him. A single Connector, who was responsible for many valuable, rewarding relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps half of my social circle is thanks to a single friend. I wonder if most people are the same way? Do we all have that friend?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>letting go of the words</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;strong&gt;Letting Go of the Words&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redish.net/&quot;&gt;Ginny Redish&lt;/a&gt; this week. Redish is a usability and communications expert, and this book takes a shotgun approach to writing good, usable content for the web. I don’t say this to be disparaging. As any of my friends can tell you, I’m a big fan of shotguns. She covers everything from organizing content in a way that makes it easy for readers to scan, to ways to improve your site for usability, to some basic tips on SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background: I used to consider myself an SEO. I spent a couple miserable years working on an ecommerce site, and I learned a lot about the basics of SEO in between hours of painstaking, mind-numbing data entry. My job eventually devolved to the point I was simply adding products to an online catalog, by hand, most days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I learned a lot about how to write a description. I learned about keywords, and keyword research, and measurement. And I don’t work there anymore, so it wasn’t a total wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t consider myself an SEO anymore. SEO is a cornerstone of writing for the web, and it’s important to keep in mind, but it’s not my primary intereste these days. I’m more interested in writing content that helps people solve problems, and less interested in making sure every blog post, article, and piece of sales copy I write has the correct keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redish offers a hands-on, practical approach to writing for the web. I like practical books. I’ve never considered myself a philosopher. I like doing work, and I do well with a list. With a framework. There’s a reason I’ve always gotten such joy from putting together a new Lego set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You will have overall purposes for your site or app or blog. You will have even more specific purposes for each part of the site, for each piece of content, for each blog article, for each part of a mobile app, for each social media message. Always ask: What do I want to happen because I wrote this?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple, effective way to start outlining any piece of content. Good web content should always focus on the reader. How well does your product solve your reader’s problem? How quickly can you make that point? What is the least amount of time you can demand from your reader?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web content isn’t the same as fiction. Fiction is a luxury. Web content needs to cut the bullshit, kill the preamble, and get to work. I love this quote by Redish. It’s about staying on task. It’s about writing with purpose, about creating content with a specific goal in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“At a recent talk in a room full of designers, I declared “No more lorem ipsum!” The designers applauded loudly. Many designers want content early. But they tell me that clients often push them to design without content. They have trouble getting content early enough. So we need to educate clients, too, to understand the importance of content strategy and how critical real content is for successful design.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roughest draft copy you can possibly imagine is better by far than a wall of dummy text. I don’t have much more to say about this idea. I’m mostly quoting Redish here because she’s stating my own opinion very clearly. I’m a human being, and human beings like to hear our own opinions reinforced, especially by those we respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came in expecting Letting Go of the Words to be a copy writing book. And it is, sort of. It’s also a usability book, and a content strategy book, and an informational architecture book. It’s about creating useful content, and it covers more than simply writing with clarity. It’s about making content accessible to disabled visitors, and structuring your content in a way that makes it easy to digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all good books on the subject, Letting Go of the Words is about doing good work. About giving a shit about the details. Even though a lot of it was review, I consider my time reading it a couple weeks well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>the art of fiction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished up The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers by John Gardner earlier this week. As I read, I felt those horrible wheels turning in my Underbrain, and several times I jumped up from reading to take notes on something I wanted to write. The surest sign that I’m reading something worth reading is how easy that book is to put down, jump up and get my hands dirty. My hands were filthy by the time I finished The Art of Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take notes when I’m reading to learn. “Reading for discovery” is how I privately think of it, and I pause often while reading to send myself emails with relevant quotes, and fragments of the larger work that resonate with me. Things I want to write about later. Anything that makes sense to me, in the larger context of wanting to be a better writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is partly in this way that the fictional process forces the writer to say more than he thought he could; that is, to make discoveries.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens every time I sit down to write. A little window into my daily writing process: I come in armed with an outline, fortified with black coffee, ready to bang out my daily word count, eager to work on the next scene, or series of scenes coming up next, according to my outline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things change. I have a general idea of where I’m going, but not how I’m going to get there. I’ve gotten a view from 50,000 feet up, enough to have a rough idea of the story I’ll write. But it’s rough, and it changes. I’ve described writing a story as a bit like excavating. It’s something like digging up a buried monument. An artifact whose shape is visible through loose soil, but something I can’t see well enough to make out details. And so I dig. And the soil shifts underfoot as I dig. And the shape of the thing itself changes as I dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find characters saying things I didn’t plan, taking actions I didn’t foresee, disappearing altogether. Shapeshifting into different people, the more time I spend with them. An example that popped up this week, from my current work: a boy and his younger brother are on a journey east. They’re alone, but they’re not scared. Being alone is familiar. They’ve left a cabin in which they’ve been holed up for a few days, and the older brother insists they bring a shovel found in the cabin with them. Despite its weight, and without bothering to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t anticipate this turn of events. I didn’t see this detail coming, but it emerged, fully formed, making complete sense within the larger arc I’m working on. It wasn’t in my outline. I didn’t know about the shovel - it was something I didn’t plan, and it has imposed itself and made itself necessary to the plot. It’s more than a wrinkle (although wrinkles also appear while writing) and heavier than texture. You make discoveries as you write. You discover about your characters, the world you’re creating, and the stories that take place there. That’s the magic. Writing is about discovery, even with an outline. Even with an outline a thousand times as detailed and structured as the ones I create, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But if the writer writes only of what honestly interests him, and if he thinks of his work not simply as thoughtful exploration, as it should be, but also as entertainment, he cannot fail to have, at least for some group of serious, devoted readers, both immediate and lasting interest.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long sentence. Much longer than most I end up writing, but my take is if you’re writing stories like the ones you like to read, rather than simply writing to hone your technique or to explore ideas, you’ll find success. If you’re having fun with what you’re writing, you’ll be successful. Every writer seeks glory, for some definition of glory. Every writer wants to see his work in the world, even if no one else ever reads it, and the surest path to get there is to write the stories you want to write. To write the kind of thing you’d read without question. Without heistation, and without complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason I’ve stuck to mostly horror (with a few side tracks into softish sci-fi) and that’s because I like reading horror. I’ve been a fan of horror since I was a child. Horror is my number one jam, now and forever. I’m writing horror not because I think of it as a fun exercise (although it certainly is that) but because I enjoy horror, and because I derive immense pleasure and personal satisfaction from working on stories about awful things happening to perfectly nice people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>april wrap up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve not been looking forward to writing this wrap up post. My current system of blogging once a month about the books I’ve read that month isn’t ideal. I am not writing well about what I’ve read, even though I’ve been taking notes and sending myself email reminders for points I want to make in my wrap up post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some ideas for improving this system, but I still think it’s important for me to talk about what I’ve been reading and what I’ve learned, so let’s jump into it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-New-Edition-Remarkable-Includes/dp/1591843170&quot;&gt;Purple Cow&lt;/a&gt; by Seth Godin, &lt;a href=&quot;http://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/&quot;&gt;Everybody Writes&lt;/a&gt; by Ann Handley, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/&quot;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Pressfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple Cow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest: at this point, I’ve read enough Seth Godin. I am beginning to see adding one of his books to my monthly line up as a bit of a cop-out. I already know I like his style. I find his books interesting and fun to read. I agree with the points he’s making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also familiar with his input, and I should branch out. Luckily, Godin has proven to be a fantastic resource for other authors to read and become familiar with, in addition to his own advice and experience as a marketer. But on to the book itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purple Cow was the usual, delightful, well-written and insightful book on a very specific marketing subject I’ve come to expect from Godin. It’s about building remarkability into your product or business from the beginning. Marketing shouldn’t be an afterthought. It should be a core component of your product. There should be something so remarkable about your product that people will want to talk about it. Your customers will want to evangelize for you, and to speak on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everybody Writes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many words do you think you write in a day? A thousand? Ten thousand? I don’t know how many I write in a day. My professional life entails reading and writing a shit ton of email, every single day. If I had to hazard a guess, and fuck it, I’ll hazard a guess, I’d say ten thousand. At the low end. And that’s not including my personal writing. That’s not including the 500 or 1,000 words a day I absolutely have to write to feel productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you have a website, you are a publisher. If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means we are all writers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love this perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing isn’t an Art. It’s a Craft, and while you certainly need some germ of talent to be a great writer, anyone can learn to write. Everyone can learn to be a better writer. Writing is accessible, and it’s one of the things I love most about writing. You just have to give a shit, learn some basic rules, and write. If you want to be a better writer, you need to write a lot, and that’s the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m constantly surprised by something I’ve noticed: people who want to be writers, without actually writing. There’s no short cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The War of Art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not have enough good things to say about this book. This is easily the most inspirational, most applicable, and best book I’ve read since I started this new system back in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I got from this book was identifying my own lazy behavior. Behavior that often gets in the way of Doing My Work (which is how I’ve begun thinking about writing, editing, and otherwise getting ideas kicking around inside my head onto paper.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressfield’s calls this Resistance. It comes from within, and it stands in between who you are and what you’re doing, and who you want to be and what you want to be doing. A telling quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get. Resistance is always lying, and always full of shit.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resistance rears its ugly head every time I don’t want to sit down and write. Every time I fuck around on Twitter and Reddit instead of writing 500 words. Every time I choose to play video games instead of editing a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Names have power, and now Mr. Pressfield has given me a name for this behavior that I’ve long been aware of, I’m finding it easier to stave off. Easier to recognize when I’m stalling, and easier to recognize when I am not using my time as well as I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is going well, by the way. I have finished a total of 7 rough drafts, a first edit, and a second edit. Unfortunately, these edits were both for the same short story. I have yet to pass it off to Jessica for review, but soon. SOON, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something about the third month of any new system I try that typically proves to be the failing point. I tend to lose motivation around month 3. My famous enthusiasm wanes, and I get bored. I move on to something else. I stop caring as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not about only working when I’m motivated. I’ve noticed I’ve been sinking into the doldrums. I haven’t been working on this site as much as I might like, for one thing. But I’m still reading. I’m still writing, every single day. I’m still making progress, so let’s talk about what I read in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;strong&gt;Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life&lt;/strong&gt; by Annie Lamott, &lt;strong&gt;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion&lt;/strong&gt; by Robert Cialdini, and &lt;strong&gt;How To Turn Words into Money&lt;/strong&gt; by Ted Nicholas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1427855361&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=bird+by+bird&quot;&gt;Bird by Bird&lt;/a&gt; was my favorite of the three. I’ve already written a blog post mostly about this book, and although I found it to be a slow start, it was a delight. Mostly a delight. Lamott is a bit pessimistic for my taste, but she had an interesting perspective on writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two were good, don’t get me wrong. I loved the insight into automatic human responses covered in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1427855417&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=influence+the+psychology+of+persuasion&quot;&gt;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion&lt;/a&gt;, and it was my second favorite this month.  Let’s be honest: I also liked it more than How To Turn Words into Money because it was better written. Both books shared an optimism and an enthusiasm for the work at hand not found in Bird by Bird. Lamott focused too much on the negative parts of writing for my taste - the anxiety of being published, the fear of running out of ideas, the dread of writing yourself into a corner. It was too easy to picture her standing in a corner, wringing her hands in between drafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influence is about the psychology of why people say yes. Why people buy things they don’t need, why people choose one option over another, and how compliance professionals can play on these factors to convince others to take desired actions. I absolutely love the term “compliance professional,” by the way. Influence is why you see a thousand logos on every marketing site. It’s why you see user testimonials. It’s why the phrase “thought leader” exists. An absolutely fascinating read! I’ve already begun noticing these tactics employed in the short time since I finished the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/How-Turn-Words-Into-Money/dp/1887741011/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1427855466&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=how+to+turn+words+into+money&quot;&gt;How To Turn Words into Money&lt;/a&gt; was not at all the book I thought it would be. I found it on a list of good copywriting books, and while it DOES touch on copywriting, all it does is touch on the subject. Nicholas takes a shotgun approach to marketing: he writes about infomercials, licensing your products to be sold overseas, and running ads in the yellow pages. Not exactly focused on copywriting. It’s a book with a central theme of the words that convert into money, with tentacles reaching out into a variety of loosely related disciplines and media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still feeling good about my reading system. April is here, and I’ve read 9 books this year that I wouldn’t have read without it. My writing system is working well. My editing system is basically garbage. I do not like editing my work, and still have not gotten through a second pass of my first story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short term goal for April: shore this up, find something that works. I’ll write about it, don’t worry!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>everything is material</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott, and this quote rang true enough I had to jump up and write about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So much of writing is about sitting down and doing it every day, and so much of it is about getting into the custom of taking in everything that comes along, seeing it all as grist for the mill.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is material. Every person I know, every song I’ve ever heard, the linoleum in my Aunt Sharon’s kitchen, the woods, the creek, and the drainage ditch that ran under the road by the country house I lived in as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful nightmare a couple weeks ago, details I’d forgotten until I got in the shower. I took a shorter shower than normal that day, eager to get clean, get dry, and write down every little detail I could remember, because it was weird, and I could smell a story in there, somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get most of my ideas in the shower, or just before I fall asleep. I like to think that’s when my underbrain is most active, talking the loudest, and I’m always ready to listen. It’s not convenient, but I’m not complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brushing my teeth before bed last night, and a handful of details about a character in a story that’s been lurking in the back of my mind rose up, unbidden, welcome as an old friend. A window opening up into the life of a young boy, lonely, on his last day on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see him, riding the bus one last time, and I can hear his conversation with the bus driver, and I can hear the panic in his mother’s voice when she realizes he’s not coming home that night, and maybe not ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I see isn’t a memory, not really. But it’s close. It’s a kissing cousin. The bus driver is the old, loud guy who drove the bus when I was this kid’s age, and I recognize the kid’s shy, nervous smile, and a thousand other details. I feel bad about what’s going to happen to this kid, because he reminds me of someone I know and care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And underneath that, I get an idea what’s going to happen may not be so bad. Not in the long run. In the short run? Sure, absolutely. And I feel bad for his mom, I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start with a plan, and I work from an outline, but I’m still just excavating. Digging, exploring, discovering what happens as I go along. That’s writing, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>wrangling jekyll for blogging</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Good news! I’ve finally mastered the fine art of using Jekyll to add a blog to my wonderful site. It actually wasn’t very difficult. Most of my time was spent exploring the deep, dark caverns around properly setting a base_url until I just said “FUCK IT” and went with my root domain, which I’ll swap out for local development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it’s actually way easier than I thought it would be. I have a long-standing, nasty habit of building very simple tasks up to be monumental undertakings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I plan to spend some time this weekend porting all of my old blog posts over from blogspot, then fully migrating everything here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Styling is still pretty boilerplate, but I’ll get to that. The main thing is the blog is up, it works, and it’s easier than I thought it would be. BONUS: made quite a bit of improvement with the layout, updating templates to be more templatey, DRYing shit up every, son.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>what i did in february; or, the nightmare of copy editing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I came out of February having read three more books, written thousands of words, and with a new and personal discovery about how much I love copy editing. &lt;strong&gt;SPOILER ALERT:&lt;/strong&gt; not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Wrote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found myself going back and digging through my Twitter feed for notes on what I wrote in any given month. I finished up one short story, began an edit of the first story I finished in January, and started another story. Cross-referencing Twitter in this way is dumb, so I’ve added another page to my progress tracking spreadsheet. That spreadsheet’s getting pretty fat, man. I’ve got lots of progress I want to track!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That old saying “Writers like having written” is hot, boiling garbage. I like writing, and I spent several blissful mornings in February drinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackheartenterprises.com/&quot;&gt;cold, black coffee&lt;/a&gt; and banging out a story. I sat down with a printed copy of my first draft, red pen in hand, only to find editing my own writing a chore beyond imagining. I’d rather have been writing something new. I’d rather have been anywhere but editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Just finish one pass. Just one first edit, then you can start another story.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the credo I lived by for over a week. But reasons not to edit my first draft kept surfacing. Somehow I made it through, though I’m still about halfway through a second pass. I blamed various interferences - a lack of good red pens, or discomfort in my computer chair when I sat down to edit. Just a string of shitty excuses to keep myself from doing the work that I knew needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll need to find a way to weasel editing into my daily routine. Some system for editing, a clever way to trick myself into it. Maybe I edit for 20 minutes every evening. After buying some new red pens, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X&quot;&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Strunk and White&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m what? 90% sure I’ve read this before? I’m reasonably certain this was required reading in one of my early journalism classes. Either way, the refresher was wonderful. This old bastard dates back to 1918, and the advice contained still feels fresh, nearly a century later. Strunk has no patience for sloppy writing, and I love that he calls poorly constructed sentences “indefensible”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Permission-Marketing-Turning-Strangers-Customers/dp/0684856360&quot;&gt;Permission Marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Seth Godin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to just put all of the other marketing books I’m planning to read this year on hold until I’ve worked through Godin’s entire library. Permission Marketing is an old book (first published in 1999) and it shows its age when Godin writes about specific companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the specifics don’t matter. He writes with self-effacing humor and a natural curiosity that makes discussion of otherwise dry, technical case studies a true pleasure to read. I’ve read a couple of his other books (The Dip, All Marketers are Liars) and he’s never disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Persuasive-Online-Copywriting-Take-Words/dp/0971476993/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425703297&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=persuasive+online+copywriting&quot;&gt;Persuasive Online Coypwriting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Bryan Eisenberg, Jeffrey Eisenberg, Lisa T. Davis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve kind of been doing a “thing” with dated online marketing books. This one was good, not as enjoyable to read as Permission Marketing, but reinforcing modern standards of online copywriting: focus on benefits, measure conversions, keep your eye on the fucking ball. Your visitors don’t give a shit about you. They give a shit about what you can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I Felt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February felt pretty good. I didn’t get as much writing done as I’d have liked (see that week spent copy editing) and I’ve discovered I dislike editing my work. This is almost certainly a “thing” for at least some set of writers, and I need to get over it. I plan to implement a new system for editing in March, considering I’ve got a handful of first drafts under my belt now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of my first story was painful, but productive. I cut out a lot of shit, removed tons of ideas that weren’t working and didn’t go anywhere, but I got bogged down in the second pass. It might be time for another, just to take what I have now, print it out again, and start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll pass it off to Miss Lady for further editing, and that idea is terrifying. Writing a story is one thing, but letting someone else read what I’ve written? AIEEEEEEE&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>what i did in january: my super rad writing system</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using my super rad writing system (500 words per day, and 1,000 words per day on the weekends) I’ve written rough drafts for two short stories and I’m most of the way through a third. It’s hard to calculate just how far I am into this third story. I’ve discovered something interesting about writing fiction - it doesn’t always go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve scoffed at people who write without an outline (and I still do, it’s MADNESS) but I have been surprised more than once at events that unfold while I’m writing. A character will make a surprise trip to a butcher’s shop, and it all feels very natural even though I didn’t plan on it in my rough outline before sitting down to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly those hilarious gems from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nanowrimo_txt&quot;&gt;@nanowrimo_txt&lt;/a&gt; make more sense. But not much more - let’s not get crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the first story using textedit, using folders and a ton of text files. This was not ideal, and I knew it, but it’s how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully planned to switch to either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulyssesapp.com/&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php&quot;&gt;Scrivener&lt;/a&gt; for the next story. I downloaded trials for both, but ended up using &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; when it came time to sit down and write, at the recommendation of my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://mileszs.com/&quot;&gt;Miles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,”&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;em&gt;“This works fine. Better than a folder full of disorganized and loosely connected text files. But I’ll give one of the other apps a shot on the next story.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. Didn’t happen. I’m still sticking with Evernote. It’s got the feature set I want (easy to organize stories and groups of stories, cloud sync, accessible from any device I can log into) without the bloat of something like Scrivener. Protip: If I have to go through a 400-step tutorial to use your writing software, I am not going to use your writing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ulysses is more light weight and seemed like a reasonable alternative, but I find it to be comparable in feature and usage to Evernote, so I don’t have a compelling reason to switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke a bit about my writing system in my last post, but I haven’t mentioned my reading system. In short, I want to read three books per month: one book on writing, one book on copywriting, and one book on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I read in January:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425703880&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=on+writing&quot;&gt;On Writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Stephen King&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Writing was a singular joy to read, and I wish I’d read it a decade ago. Stephen King is the reason I wanted to be an author as a child, and this book was the perfect combination of memoir and practical writing advice from a master of the genre. Bonus: tons of interesting insights into horror stories I read in high school, how he wrote them, where he was when he wrote them, and the impact they had on his family’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425703914&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=ogilvy+on+advertising&quot;&gt;Ogilvy on Advertising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by David Ogilvy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogilvy on Advertising and The Copywriter’s Handbook were less enjoyable to read, but full of practical information. I was surprised to find Ogilvy on Advertising felt less dated than The Copywriter’s Handbook, likely because Ogilvy focused less on specifics than Bly did. Ogilvy’s relentless focus on provable, measureable results is fascinating. He was talking about data-driven marketing (a common enough practice in 2015) way back in the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Copywriters-Handbook-Step---Step-Writing/dp/0805078045/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425704153&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=copywriter%27s+handbook&quot;&gt;The Copywriter’s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Robert Bly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copy of The Copywriter’s Handbook I read had a new section on writing for the web (this version was published in 2005 or so) and felt hilariously dated in 2015. Tons of mentions of “e-zines”, for example, although the strategies Bly wrote about in 2005 still apply today (collecting emails, running drip campaigns, selling with benefits). Again, much like Ogilvy: work on something you can measure. Try new approaches, measure the results, get better over time. Solid, practical advice for any marketer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread I noticed in all three of these books is each writer takes a practical, craftsman-like approach to writing. These aren’t flowery authors. They write about the “craft” of writing, not the “art”, which appeals to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts on My Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month in and I’m feeling good about these systems. I’ve gotten a lot more done in a single month than I typically do, and that persistent, nagging feeling that I should be using my spare time more productively has all but vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already thought of ways to extend and improve these systems - bumping up my word count, for example, and keeping notes on the book I’m reading as I read it. This would help with summary blog posts at the end of the month, and I’d be able to talk about a book I read three weeks ago with more salient points than “It was good, I liked it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, off to a good start. Feels good to talk about things I’ve done, not things I plan to do. I feel less pressure to keep a promise I’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this and you’ve got book recommendations, writing tips or anything else you’d like to rap about, I’m all ears. You’ve been on the internet before. You know how to leave a comment on a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
