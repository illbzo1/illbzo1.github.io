      <p><em>On Writing Well</em> by <a href="http://www.williamzinsserwriter.com/">William Zinsser</a> is one of the best books on writing I’ve ever read. Zinsser was a writer, a journalist, and a teacher.  <em>On Writing Well</em> is the kind of practical, no-bullshit approach to writing I love reading.</p>

Why Airwalks were incredibly popular for a few years in the mid-90s, and why their popularity died off.</p>

      <p>I finished reading <strong>Letting Go of the Words</strong> by <a href="http://www.redish.net/">Ginny Redish</a> this week. Redish is a usability and communications expert, and this book takes a shotgun approach to writing good, usable content for the web. I don’t say this to be disparaging. As any of my friends can tell you, I’m a big fan of shotguns. She covers everything from organizing content in a way that makes it easy for readers to scan, to ways to improve your site for usability, to some basic tips on SEO.</p>

      <p>I finished up The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers by John Gardner earlier this week. As I read, I felt those horrible wheels turning in my Underbrain, and several times I jumped up from reading to take notes on something I wanted to write. The surest sign that I’m reading something worth reading is how easy that book is to put down, jump up and get my hands dirty. My hands were filthy by the time I finished The Art of Fiction.</p>
